This has been my bible since I first laid hands on it around 1972. It is witty, observant, educative, entertaining and has the endearing charm of being one of those books you can open at any page or chapter and dive right in or skim. If there is any negative criticism I might lay at its pages, it would be a lack of cross-indexing. But this being the 21st Century, I'm sure there is an electronic version with a word search. A tiny quote from the chapter entitled ""When is a Leader not a Leader"" illustrates perfectly why I love this book and why it has been my rock when I have been in a hard place:- ... the normal corporation interview [is] to me as 'about as scientific as a couple of dogs sniffing each other's arses'. That could ONLY be written by the man who later was to produce the extraordinary insight into British Politics and the Civil Service:- ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes Prime Minister"".

What she doesn't understand is why...As a child Beth seeks solace in the noisy, energetic household of the Frederick family across the street. Dan Frederick soon becomes her best friend and the lives of the two families are drawn together. Almost twenty years later, after the Fredericks have divorced and Beth has left home, Beth is reunited with Dan. Embarking on an affair that will shatter the serenity of both families, Beth and Dan come face to face with their pasts, leading Beth to the shocking truth behind the thirty-year-old tragedy that has shaped all their lives...

The Operating System,Eric Laursen,political_science,2021.0,OL24603575W,//archive.org/services/img/the-operating-system-an-anarchist-theory-eric-laursen,"One of the most unique aspects of anarchism as a political philosophy is that it seeks to abolish the state. But what exactly is “the state”? The State is like a vast operating system for ordering and controlling relations among human society, the economy, and the natural world, analogous to a digital operating system like Windows or MacOS. Like a state, an operating system “governs” the programs and applications under it and networked with it, as well as, to some extent, the individuals who avail themselves of these tools and resources. No matter how different states seem on the surface they share core similarities, namely:         The State is a relatively new thing in world history        The State is European in origin and outlook        States are “individuals” in the eyes of the law        The State claims the right to determine who is a person        The State is an instrument of violence and war        The State is above the law        The State is first and foremost an economic endeavor    Anyone concerned with entrenched power, income inequality, lack of digital privacy, climate change, the amateurish response to COVID-19, or military-style policing will find eye-opening insights into how states operate and build more power for themselves—at our expense. The state won’t solve our most pressing problems, so why do we obey? It’s time to think outside the state.  (Source)   Read more Read less",AK Press

Diplomacy,Geoff Berridge,political_science,2005.0,OL20008103W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""This revised fifth edition of the bestselling Diplomacy, from globally renowned thinker and scholar in diplomacy research and teaching Geoff Berridge, takes into account crucial developments and shifts on the global stage in the last 5 years. At the heart of diplomacy, and a central theme of this book, is the art of negotiation. As well as involving choice of its most promising channels, this includes how to sustain momentum via a deadline, for the consequences of not settling by midnight on the clock of the talks usually concentrates minds. The examples included, such as the Iran nuclear talks, are mostly contemporary, but historical background to the diplomatic methods themselves is always provided. This helps to show that a rejuvenation of key features of traditional diplomacy has occurred in recent years that has gone largely unnoticed, partly because new labels have been given to old procedures, a notable instance being the rebranding of propaganda as 'public diplomacy'. Fully updated, new case studies explore lessons of the 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane, and those of the highly topical Budapest Memorandum on Ukraine. Berridge's comprehensive and invaluable text also includes new chapters on secret intelligence and economic and commercial diplomacy""--   Read more Read less",

When the Tuna Went Down to Texas,Mike Shropshire,autobiography,2004.0,OL2669397W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7278961M-M.jpg,"E-Book Extra: Parcells in a NutshellBill Parcells was living in self-imposed exile from the National Football League sidelines. The Tuna had earned living-legend status after coaching the Giants, Patriots, and Jets from the skid-row district of the NFL and transforming those teams into champions. The final weeks of the 2002 season found Parcells working as an analyst at the ESPN studios. His heart aching, Parcells was like a televangelist with no cripples to heal. The Tuna urgently yearned for another lost cause.In Dallas, Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones -- described by author Mike Shropshire as ""a man involved in a heroic struggle to overcome what had been diagnosed as a terminal face-lift"" -- was suffering through sleepless nights. Although his once-proud pro football powerhouse traveled beneath a banner that read ""America's Team,"" it had suffered three straight 5-11 seasons. This team was so sick, it had bedsores.After a clandestine meeting aboard Jones's private jet, parked at a New Jersey airport, Parcells agreed to abandon his East Coast roots and travel south to restore life to the Cowboys. The Tuna and Jones needed each other in the worst kind of way, so a shotgun wedding was performed. The pundits of the national media joined hands and shouted, ""Parcells and Jones can't stand each other! They're too set in their ways! It'll never work!""As usual, the pundits were wrong. With Parcells the ultimate motivator and so-called Jock Whisperer applying his craft, Dallas rolled to a 10-6 regular-season record and shocked the NFL by making the playoffs. When the Tuna Went Down to Texas details the saga of how this unlikely partnership of men ""too brittle for tango lessons, but not yet blind enough for assisted living"" amazed the sports world and serves as absolute proof that while the truth is not always stranger than fiction, it's usually a lot funnier.

While a rich tradition existed in men s tailoring, menswear was seen as very much the poor relation to womenswear. Times have changed: menswear, notably that created and produced by independent labels, is a hotbed of creativity; separate fashion weeks devoted to menswear are now held in Paris, London, and Milan; and the menswear scene is hotly discussed, critiqued, and debated in the press and online. Contemporary Menswear presents in-depth profiles of more than fifty of the designers, labels, brands, stores, websites, and blogs that have shaped and continue to shape menswear in the twenty-first century. From classic heritage labels such as Albam Clothing through to dynamic, new labels such as Tellason (crafted, desirable denim) this is a detailed and insightful guide to an independent menswear scene that has grown to be a respected and highly creative part of global fashion.""

The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,Michael Chabon,humor,1957.0,OL119436W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL37872403M-M.jpg,"The novel begins in 1939 with the arrival of 19-year-old Josef ""Joe"" Kavalier as a refugee in New York City, where he comes to live with his 17-year-old cousin Sammy Klayman. Joe escaped from Prague with the help of his teacher Kornblum by hiding in a coffin along with the inanimate Golem of Prague, leaving the rest of his family, including his younger brother Thomas, behind. Besides having a shared interest in drawing, Sammy and Joe share several connections to Jewish stage magician Harry Houdini: Joe (like comics legend Jim Steranko) studied magic and escapology in Prague, which aided him in his departure from Europe, and Sammy is the son of the Mighty Molecule, a strongman on the vaudeville circuit.  When Sammy discovers Joe's artistic talent, Sammy gets Joe a job as an illustrator for a novelty products company, which, due to the recent success of Superman, is attempting to get into the comic-book business. Under the name ""Sam Clay"", Sammy starts writing adventure stories with Joe illustrating them, and the two recruit several other Brooklyn teenagers to produce Amazing Midget Radio Comics (named to promote one of the company's novelty items). The pair is at once passionate about their creation, optimistic about making money, and always nervous about the opinion of their employers. The magazine features Sammy and Joe's character the Escapist, an anti-fascist superhero who combines traits of (among others) Captain America, Harry Houdini, Batman, the Phantom, and the Scarlet Pimpernel. The Escapist becomes tremendously popular, but like talent behind Superman, the writers and artists of the comic get a minimal share of their publisher's revenue. Sammy and Joe are slow to realize that they are being exploited, as they have private concerns: Joe is trying to help his family escape from Nazi-occupied Prague, and has fallen in love with the bohemian Rosa Saks, who has her own artistic aspirations, while Clay is battling with his sexual identity and the lackluster progress of his literary career.  For many months after coming to New York, Joe is driven almost solely by an intense desire to improve the condition of his family, still living under a regime increasingly hostile to their kind. This drive shows through in his work, which remains for a long time unabashedly anti-Nazi despite his employer's concerns. In the meantime, he is spending more and more time with Rosa, appearing as a magician in the bar mitzvahs of the children of Rosa's father's acquaintances, even though he sometimes feels guilty at indulging in these distractions from the primary task of fighting for his family. After multiple attempts and considerable monetary sacrifice, Joe ultimately fails to get his family to the States, his last attempt having resulted in putting his younger brother aboard a ship that sank into the Atlantic. Distraught and unaware that Rosa is pregnant with his child, Joe enlists in the navy, hoping to fight the Germans. Instead, he is sent to a lonely, cold naval base in Antarctica, from which he emerges the lone survivor after a series of deaths. When he makes it back to New York, ashamed to show his face again to Rosa and Sammy, he lives and sleeps in a hideout in the Empire State Building, known only to a small circle of magician-friends.  Meanwhile, Sam battles with his sexuality, shown mostly through his relationship with the radio voice of The Escapist, Tracy Bacon. Bacon's movie-star good-looks initially intimidate Clay, but they later fall in love. When Tracy is cast as The Escapist in the film version, he invites Clay to move to Hollywood with him, an offer that Clay accepts. But later, when Bacon and Clay go to a friend's beach house with several other gay men and couples, the company's private dinner is broken up by the local police as well as two off-duty FBI agents. All of the men are arrested, except for two who hid under the dinner table, one of whom is Clay. The FBI agents each claim one of the men and grant them their freedom in return for sexual favors. After this episode, Clay decides that he can't live with the constant threat of being arrested, ridiculed, and judged because of his sexuality. He does not go with Bacon to the West Coast. Some time after Joe leaves, Sammy marries Rosa and moves with her to the suburbs, where they raise her son Tommy in what outwardly appears to be a typical traditional nuclear family.  Sammy and Rosa cannot hide all their secrets from Tommy, however, who manages to take private magic lessons in the Empire State Building from Joe for the better part of year without anyone else's knowledge. Tommy is instrumental in finally reuniting the Kavalier and Clay duo, which works with renewed enthusiasm to find a new creative direction for comics. Joe moves into Sammy and Rosa's house. Shortly afterwards, Sammy's homosexuality is revealed on public television. This further complicates the attempts of Rosa, Sammy, and Joe to reconstitute a family.  Many events in the novel are based on the lives of actual comic-book creators including Jack Kirby (to whom the book is dedicated in the afterword), Stan Lee, Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Joe Simon, Will Eisner, and Jim Steranko. Other historical figures play minor roles, including Salvador Dalí, Al Smith, Orson Welles, and Fredric Wertham. The novel's time span roughly mirrors that of the Golden Age of Comics itself, starting from shortly after the debut of Superman and concluding with the Kefauver Senate hearings, two events often used to demarcate the era.

Blind spot,Teju Cole,photography,2017.0,OL19714204W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"When it comes to Teju Cole, the unexpected is not unfamiliar: he's an acclaimed novelist, an influential essayist, and an internationally exhibited photographer. In Blind Spot, readers follow Coles inimitable artistic vision into the visual realm as he continues to refine the voice, eye, and intellectual obsessions that earned him such acclaim for Open City. Here, journey through more than 150 of Coles full-color, original photos, each accompanied by his lyrical and evocative prose, forming a multimedia diary of years of near-constant travel: from a park in Berlin to a mountain range in Switzerland, a church exterior in Lagos to a parking lot in Brooklyn; landscapes, beautiful or quotidian, that inspire Coles memories, fantasies, and introspections. Ships in Capri remind him of the work of writers from Homer to Edna O'Brien; a hotel room in Wannsee brings back a disturbing dream about a friends death; a home in Tivoli evokes a transformative period of semi-blindness, after which ""the photography changed. . . . The looking changed."" As exquisitely wrought as the work of Anne Carson or Chris Marker, Blind Spot is a testament to the art of seeing by one of the most powerful and original voices in contemporary literature.

Celeste has chosen and lured the charmingly modest Jack Patrick into her web. Jack is enthralled and in awe of his eighth-grade teacher, and, most importantly, willing to accept Celeste's terms for a secret relationship--car rides after dark, rendezvous at Jack's house while his single father works the late shift, and body-slamming erotic encounters in Celeste's empty classroom. In slaking her sexual thirst, Celeste Price is remorseless and deviously free of hesitation, a monstress of pure motivation. She deceives everyone, is close to no one, and cares little for anything but her pleasure. Tampa is a sexually explicit, virtuosically satirical, American Psycho-esque rendering of a monstrously misplaced but undeterrable desire. Laced with black humor and crackling sexualized prose, Alissa Nutting's Tampa is a grand, seriocomic examination of the want behind student / teacher affairs and a scorching literary debut.""--Publisher's statement.

Timing and turnout,Sarah F. Anzia,political_science,2013.0,OL19987529W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""Public policy in the United States is the product of decisions made by more than 500,000 elected officials, and the vast majority of those officials are elected on days other than Election Day. And because far fewer voters turn out for off-cycle elections, that means the majority of officials in America are elected by a politically motivated minority of Americans. Sarah F. Anzia is the first to systemically address the effects of election timing on political outcomes, and her findings are eye-opening. The low turnout for off-cycle elections, Anzia argues, increases the influence of organized interest groups like teachers' unions and municipal workers. While such groups tend to vote at high rates regardless of when the election is held, the low turnout in off-cycle years enhances the effectiveness of their mobilization efforts and makes them a proportionately larger bloc. Throughout American history, the issue of election timing has been a contentious one. Anzia's book traces efforts by interest groups and political parties to change the timing of elections to their advantage, resulting in the electoral structures we have today. Ultimately, what might seem at first glance to be mundane matters of scheduling are better understood as tactics designed to distribute political power, determining who has an advantage in the electoral process and who will control government at the municipal, county, and state levels."" -- Publisher's description.

Yet it remains a nation hobbled by rigid gender roles, protectionist policies, and a defensive, inflexible corporate system that has helped bring about political and economic stagnation. The unique social cohesion that enabled Japan to cope with adversity and develop swiftly has also encouraged isolationism, given rise to an arrogant and inflexible bureaucracy, and prevented the country from addressing difficult issues. Its culture of hard work--in fact, overwork--is legendary, but a declining population and restrictions on opportunity threaten the nation's future.

Being woefully unschooled in the ways of passion, however, Marietta, at Aphrodite's insistence, must first prove herself by properly seducing one man: Max Valland, the moody, disgraced, anddisinherited former Lord Roseby.With his life and reputation already in tatters, Max is most willing to help the exquisite young minx practice her chosen craft—though he is surprised at the depth of his desire... and by her most unprofessional tenderness. But Marietta's plans are threatened by the dangerous mysteries swirling around this disarmingly sensual gentleman... and by a heart that urges her to break the courtesan's  cardinal rule: never fall in love.

Beginning with the death of the earthling's mother and ending with a confrontation with his own mortality, the poems within Earthling resist complaint or agitation.

I am Madame X,Gioia Diliberto,historical_fiction,2003.0,OL15837138W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24747212M-M.jpg,"The life of Virginie Gautreau, the notorious beauty of Madame X, John Singer Sargent's most famous and scandalous portrait, provides inspiration for this absorbing and intriguing novel.  Madame X caused an immediate furor when Sargent unveiled it at the 1884 Paris Salon. The subject's bold pose, provocative dress, and decadent pallor shocked the public, and the critics panned the picture, smashing Sargent's dream of a Paris career. The artist soon relocated to England, where he established himself as the favorite portrait painter of the wealthy.  In this remarkable novel, Gioia Diliberto tells Virginie's story, drawing on the sketchy facts of Virginie's life to re-create her tempestuous personality and the captivating milieu of nineteenth-century Paris. Born in New Orleans to two of Louisiana's prominent Creole families and raised at Parlange, her grandmother's lush plantation, Virginie fled to France with her mother and sister during the Civil War. The family settled in Paris among other expatriate Southerners and hoped, through their French ancestry, to insinuate themselves into high society. They soon were absorbed into the fascinating and wealthy world of grand ballrooms, dressmakers' salons, luxurious country estates, and artists' ateliers. Because of Virginie's striking appearance and vivid character, her mother pinned the family's hopes for social acceptance on her daughter, who became a ""professional beauty"" and married a French banker. Even before Sargent painted her portrait, Virginie's reputation for promiscuity and showy self-display made her the subject of vicious Paris gossip.  I Am Madame X is a compulsively readable immersion in Belle Epoque Paris. It is also the story of a great work of art, illuminating the struggle between Virginie and Sargent as they fought to control the outcome of a painting that changed their lives and affected the course of art history.

Living like you mean it,Ronald J. Frederick,psychology,2009.0,OL13623357W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22569262M-M.jpg,"In LIVING LIKE YOU MEAN IT, author Ronald J. Frederick, does a brilliant job of describing why people are so afraid of their emotions and how this fear creates a variety of problems in their lives. While the problems are different, the underlying issue is often the same. At the core of their distress is what Dr. Frederick refers to as feelings phobia. Whether it s the experience of love, joy, anger, sadness, or surprise, our inborn ability to be a fully feeling person has been hijacked by fear--and it s fear that s keeping us from a better life.   The book begins with a questionnaire-style list that help readers take an honest look at themselves and recognize whether and how they are afraid of their feelings. It then moves on to explore the origins of fear of feeling and introduces a four-part program for overcoming the fear: (1) Become aware of and learn to recognize feelings--anger, sadness, joy, love, fear, guilt/shame, surprise, disgust. (2) Master techniques for taming the fear. (3) Let the feeling work its way all the way through to its resolution. (4) Open up and put those feelings into words and communicate them confidently. With wisdom, humor, and compassion, the book uses stories and examples to help readers see that overcoming feelings phobia is the key to a better life and more fulfilling relationships.

Is Shakespeare Dead?,Mark Twain,literature,1909.0,OL54078W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL20149192M-M.jpg,"Did Francis Bacon write the works of Shakespear? The Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's Works; the Baconian knows that Francis Bacon wrote them; the Brontosaurian doesn't really know which of them did it, but is quite composedly and contentedly sure that Shakespeare DIDN'T, and strongly suspects that Bacon DID. We all have to do a good deal of assuming, but I am fairly certain that in every case I can call to mind the Baconian assumers have come out ahead of the Shakespearites. Both parties handle the same materials, but the Baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and rational and persuasive results out of them than is the case with the Shakespearites. This books reaveals many facts revolving around Shakespear's death and comparisons to ""his"" writings and Bacon's.

As locals leave for jobs in cities they are replaced by neo-hippies, lifestyle-seekers, eco-activists, and labour migrants from beyond the EU.  With detailed ethnographic examples, contributors analyse new modes of living rurally and emerging forms of social organisation. As incomers’ dreams come up against residents’ realities, they detail the clashes and the cooperations between old and new residents. They make us rethink the rural/urban divide, investigate regionalists’ politicisation of rural life and heritage, and reveal how locals use EU monies to prop up or challenge existing hierarchies. They expose the consequences of and reactions to grand EU-restructuring policies, which at times threaten to turn the countryside into a manicured playground for escapee urbanites.  This book will appeal to anyone seriously interested in the realities of rural life.   Read more Read less",Manchester University Press

Wall Street Versus America,Gary Weiss,finance,2006.0,OL8135311W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23077310M-M.jpg,"For several years high-profile corporate wrongdoers have been vilified by the media. Yet the problem, according to investigative journalist Weiss, is not just a few isolated instances of malfeasance. The problem is in the very fabric of Wall Street and its practices that enable and even encourage corruption--practices that are so pervasive and so difficult to combat that they are in effect perfect crimes, with the small investor left holding the bag. Weiss describes how the ethos of Mafia chophouses, boiler rooms, and penny stock peddlers now permeates all of Wall Street. Protected from investor lawsuits by laughably corrupt arbitration systems, Wall Street firms are free to fleece unsuspecting clients with little or no risk. But as this book shows, ordinary investors can fight back and come out on top--if they learn to recognize warning signs, filter media chatter, and spot looming corporate meltdowns in advance.--From publisher description.

It comprises discussion of the literature, history and repertory of the violin and viola, the myriad relevant primary sources and their interpretation, and the various aspects of style and technique that combine to make up well-grounded, period performances. It also considers various related family instruments, contains practical advice on the acquisition of appropriate instruments, and offers suggestions for further reading and investigation. Many of the principles outlined are put into practice in case studies of six works composed c.1700-c.1900, the core period which forms this series' principal (though not exclusive) focus. Music by Corelli, Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Brahms is examined with a view to recreating performances as faithful as possible to the composer's original intention.

Nurse Amy Leatheran had never felt the lure of the ‘mysterious East,’ but she nonetheless accepts an assignment at Hassanieh, an ancient site deep in the Iraqi desert, to care for the wife of a celebrated archaeologist. Mrs Leidner is suffering bizarre visions and nervous terror. ‘I’m afraid of being killed!’ she admits to her nurse. Her terror, unfortunately, is anything but unfounded, and Nurse Leatheran is soon enough without a patient. The world’s greatest detective happens to be in the vicinity, however: having concluded an assignment in Syria, and curious about the dig at Hassanieh, Hercule Poirot arrives in time to lead a murder investigation that will tax even his remarkable powers -- and in a part of the world that has seen more than its share of misadventure and foul play.

Unique in its emphasis on foundational aspects, it is intended to be used in a rigorous, proof-oriented course to an audience consisting of advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students. In devel- oping the necessary techniques from scratch, the only background assumed is basic mathematics. An introductory chapter describes the main contents of the book in an intuitive and informal manner and grives the reader a valuable perspective of modern control theory. While linear systems are the focus of much of the presentation, most definitions and many results are given in a far more general framework. And though mostly elementary, the text includes illustrations of the applications in control of techniques from Lie groups, nonlinear analysis, commutative algebra, and other areas of ""pure"" mathematics. With an emphasis on a complete and totally self-contained presentation and containing an extensive (almost 400 entries) up-to-date bibliography and a detailed index, Mathematical Control Theory will be an excellent research reference source as well. The book covers the algebraic theory of linear systems, - including controllability, observability, feedback equivalence, families of systems, controlled invariant subspaces, realization, and minimality, - stability via Lyapunov as well as input/output methods, ideas of optimal control, observers and dynamic feedback, parameterization of stabilizing controllers, tracking, Kalman filtering (introduced through a deterministic version of ""optimal observation""), and basic facts about frequency domain such as the Nyquist criterion. Several nonlinear topics, such as Volterra series, smooth feedback stabilization, and finite-experiment observability, as well as many results in automata theory of relevance for discrete-event control, are also included. The text highlights the distinctions and the similarities between continuous and discrete time systems, as well as the sampling process that relates them.   Read more Read less",Springer US

The French city of Orleans is under siege, and the English soldiers tear through the countryside. In the quiet of her parents' garden in Domremy, a twelve-year-old peasant girl, Jehanne, hears a voice that will change her life - and the course of European history. The tale of Jehanne d'Arc, the saint and warrior who believed she had been chosen by God to save France, and who led an army of 10,000 soldiers against the English, has captivated our imagination for centuries. But the story of Jehanne - the girl - whose sister was murdered by the English, who sought an escape from her violent father and a forced marriage, who taught herself to ride, and fight, and lead, and who somehow found the courage and tenacity to convince first one, then two, then tens, then thousands to follow her, is at once thrilling, unexpected and heart-breaking.""--Publisher description.

The Volunteer Revolution: Unleashing the Power of Everybody,Bill Hybels,management,2004.0,OL135908W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9460641M-M.jpg,"Pastor Bill Hybels believes that there is a new reality in America.  The church has entered an era of growth and unprecedented spiritual opportunity to share the Gospel, yet at the same time we face a shrinking economy and a world in crisis.  This poses a great resource challenge for the church.  In order to reach out to people who are spiritually hungry, the church needs more people to be equipped to serve others.  Hybels passionately believes the key to the future of the church is the equation 'X (paid staff) + Y (volunteers) = Z (bearing much fruit for God's glory).'  Churches cannot afford to continue hiring more and more staff with limited budgets.  The key to resourcing the church is what Hybels calls 'the Y factor.'  The Y factor is the pool of volunteers in every church. The great need of the church is to grow the church's volunteer base through the equipping ministry of church staffs.  As churches recover the message of Ephesians 4:11-12 to 'equip God's people for works of service' they will launch a Volunteer Revolution.  People are just waiting to discover the gifts and passions that God has given them to serve others and then be invited to use those gifts and passions through the local church in order to advance the kingdom of God on Earth.  Hybels believes that every church staff should be helping people discover their spiritual gifts, passions and place of service in order to meet the growing needs in our churches and world.  Hybels makes a clarion call to move beyond volunteer retention to volunteer acquisition.  By attracting, connecting, training, and sustaining volunteers, churches will mobilize people into places of service that will bring new meaning to their lives and understand why God put them on planet Earth.  Hybels also outlines how we can build lifelong volunteers in the church through community, celebration, and commendation.   Read more Read less",Zondervan

Based on more than 20 years of clinical experience and highlighting stories from his own practice, Ablow shows how ignoring or burying painful memories and experiences can negatively affect every aspect of our lives, and he presents strategies to help the reader transform the pain of the past into the power of the future. In a world where short-term talk therapy and medication are the latest trends to ""fixing"" an unhappy life, Ablow's message is controversial. But though examining the past can be daunting, LIVING THE TRUTH is as comforting and rewarding as it is transformative. And through Ablow's fine storytelling skills, empathetic voice, and straight-up advice, the experience of reading this extraordinary book becomes the first step to living a truly authentic life.

But the plague, personified by its unchecked and insidious movement through the Cumberland, cuts down these four lives, leaving Chad and his dog, Jack, to seek another place to work and sleep. He comes to the Valley of Kingdom Come, and his noble resolve and conspicuous poverty appeals to the childless Major Buford. When the Major learns that Chad is a distant relative, he introduces the boy to the Southern aristocracy and becomes his mentor. Chad takes the notice of Southern belle Margaret Dean, but as gossip of his illegitimacy arises, Chad returns to the hills through the unselfish work of a mountain girl, Melissa Turner, who loves Chad and forsakes her love for his peace. The rumors are untrue, and he is absolved of accountability for deceit. He returns to Lexington, and the Civil War breaks out. Most of his friends and neighbors (the Bufords and the Deans) join the Confederacy while Chad and Harry Dean join with Union forces. Dan Dean is captured and sentenced to death while Chad's military squad is sent to investigate the Dean's house. Dan's life is redeemed when Chad argues the authorities in Dan's defense. Margaret accommodates the quarreling blue and grey forces by directly presenting their contentious disagreements for review. Melissa, meanwhile, goes back to the mountains, satisfied that Chad is happy. ""Once again he was starting life over afresh, with his old capital, a strong body and a stout heart.""

Until I find you: a novel,John Irving,psychology,2005.0,OL14858712W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3424010M-M.jpg,"Until I Find You is the story of the actor Jack Burns -- his life, loves, celebrity and astonishing search for the truth about his parents. When he is four years old, Jack travels with his mother Alice, a tattoo artist, to several North Sea ports in search of his father, William Burns. From Copenhagen to Amsterdam, William, a brilliant church organist and profligate womanizer, is always a step ahead -- has always just departed in a wave of scandal, with a new tattoo somewhere on his body from a local master or ""scratcher.""Alice and Jack abandon their quest, and Jack is educated at schools in Canada and New England -- including, tellingly, a girls' school in Toronto. His real education consists of his relationships with older women -- from Emma Oastler, who initiates him into erotic life, to the girls of St. Hilda's, with whom he first appears on stage, to the abusive Mrs. Machado, whom he first meets when sent to learn wrestling at a local gym. Too much happens in this expansive, eventful novel to possibly summarize it all. Emma and Jack move to Los Angeles, where Emma becomes a successful novelist and Jack a promising actor. A host of eccentric minor characters memorably come and go, including Jack's hilariously confused teacher the Wurtz; Michelle Maher, the girlfriend he will never forget; and a precocious child Jack finds in the back of an Audi in a restaurant parking lot. We learn about tattoo addiction and movie cross-dressing, ""sleeping in the needles"" and the cure for cauliflower ears. And John Irving renders his protagonist's unusual rise through Hollywood with the same vivid detail and range of emotions he gives to the organ music Jack hears as a child in European churches. This is an absorbing and moving book about obsession and loss, truth and storytelling, the signs we carry on us and inside us, the traces we can't get rid of. Jack has always lived in the shadow of his absent father. But as he grows older -- and when his mother dies -- he starts to doubt the portrait of his father's character she painted for him when he was a child. This is the cue for a second journey around Europe in search of his father, from Edinburgh to Switzerland, towards a conclusion of great emotional force.A melancholy tale of deception, Until I Find You is also a swaggering comic novel, a giant tapestry of life's hopes. It is a masterpiece to compare with John Irving's great novels, and restates the author's claim to be considered the most glorious, comic, moving novelist at work today.From the Hardcover edition.

The New Communitarians and the Crisis of Modern Liberalism,Bruce P. Frohnen,religion,1996.0,OL2989202W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL815868M-M.jpg,"This book critiques and challenges the rise of communitarian thought in America. With a skeptical eye, Bruce Frohnen seeks to cut through the communitarians' rhetoric of community, commitment, and spirituality to reveal the egalitarian materialism at the core of their enterprise.  Frohnen argues that the ""new communitarians""—exemplified by political philosophers Charles Taylor and William Galston, as well as popularizers like Bill Clinton, Amitai Etzioni, Garry Wills, Mario Cuomo, and Robert Bellah—are actually old liberals trying to salvage political legitimacy by advocating allegiance to the ""sacred"" state rather than the traditions of family, church, and community.  Frohnen chastises the communitarians for confiscating the language of religion for purely political ends-a calculating attempt to rescue their thinly disguised liberalism from its own morally bankrupt decline. In effect, he criticizes what he perceives as the communitarians' misguided attempts to displace religion from the center of moral education and political life in the quest for an unachievable secular utopia. Their sacramental politics seek to harness awe and the impulse to worship in the service of the state. Frohnen, however, suggests that this effort has only served to further damage the relationship between tradition and belief on which our society is truly based.  Like the old liberals, the new communitarians continue to distort liberalism's original enterprise of freeing individuals from the constraints of tyrannical government. Instead, they advocate increasing government constraints to protect us from poverty and other material conditions that prevent us from leading our own version of the good life. Unfortunately, Frohnen contends, this attempt undermines the soul of self-reliance that provides the virtuous foundation of liberal economics, and, indeed, any good life lived in common.  Like Frohnen's first book, Virtue and the Promise of Conservatism, this volume is a tempered but resolute defense of traditional values and institutions confronting the rationalistic and materialistic excesses of a faithless age. In the dark night of the American soul, it flashes a warning to us that the ""bridge is out"" and we had better turn back or risk plunging into blackwater chaos.

When this is violated, the CDS price can be viewed as an upper bound on the price of credit risk, while the spread provides a lower bound. It is shown that the CDS market is the main forum for credit risk price discovery and that CDS prices are better integrated with firm-specific variables in the short run. Both markets equally reflect these factors in the long run, and this is primarily brought about by bond market adjustment""--Bank of England web site.   Read more Read less",Bank of England

The Essential Pope Benedict XVI,John F Thornton,religion,2008.0,OL15186196W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24318262M-M.jpg,"On April 24, 2005, Cardinal Joseph Alois Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI, the twenty-first-century successor of the Apostle Peter and the spiritual leader of more than one billion Roman Catholics. Who is this complex man whose office grants him sole charge of the world's largest religion? How will his tenure influence the future? The Essential Pope Benedict XVI answers these questions through carefully chosen selections from his homilies, interviews, theological essays, and articles on the crises facing the church today. This collection lays out Benedict's thinking and relates it to a variety of contemporary issues, including modern culture's abandonment of traditional religious values, social mores regarding conception and the sanctity of life, current challenges to the priesthood, and the Catholic Church's tenuous relations with other world religions.First a brilliant peritus, or ""expert advisor,"" to the Second Vatican Council and then archbishop of Munich, Joseph Ratzinger was appointed head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith by Pope John Paul II in 1981. As Cardinal Ratzinger, the ex officio defender of church doctrine, he gained a reputation as a heroic guardian of the faith for conservatives and was held in suspicion by church liberals.We cannot yet know what issues and events will define the reign of Pope Benedict XVI, but by any measure he will be seen as one of the most important theological voices of our time. This one volume is the best source for understanding the heart, soul, and agenda of this twenty-first-century successor to St. Peter.   Read more Read less",HarperCollins

Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list). With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house ""spark joy"" (and which don't), this book featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home -- and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.

Now, this unique book, written by a long-established team of scientists, brings this exciting, cross-disciplinary area of research to a wider readership. It shows how this team's multidisciplinary, investigative methods and the unique resource of the Egyptian Mummy Tissue Bank are being used for the new major international investigations of disease evolution and ancient Egyptian pharmacy and pharmacology. It also assesses the current status of palaeopathology and ancient DNA research, and treatments available for conserving mummified remains. Descriptions of the historical development of Egyptian mummifications and medicine and detailed references to previous scientific investigations provide the context for firsthand accounts of cutting-edge research by prominent specialists in this field, demonstrating how these techniques can contribute to a new perspective on Egyptology.

Even if he is gorgeous and successful Calvin Morrisey. Cal knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. Even if she does wear great shoes and keeps him on his toes. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.  But Fate has other plans, and it's not long before Min and Cal meet again. Soon, they're dealing with a jealous ex-boyfriend, Krispy Kreme donuts, a determined psychologist, chaos theory, a freakishly intelligent cat, Chicken Marsala, and more risky propositions than either of them ever dreamed of.

Through twists of fate, curses, and just plain human error, they find themselves deep in the jungle, where they encounter a tribe awaiting the return of the leader and the mythical book of wisdom that will protect them from the ravages and destruction of the Myanmar military regime.Filled with Amy Tan's signature ""idiosyncratic, sympathetic characters, haunting images, historical complexity, significant contemporary themes, and suspenseful mystery"" (Los Angeles Times), Saving Fish from Drowning seduces the reader with a facade of Buddhist illusions, magician's tricks, and light comedy, even as the absurd and picaresque spiral into a gripping morality tale about the consequences of intentions-both good and bad-and about the shared responsibility that individuals must accept for the actions of others.A pious man explained to his followers: ""It is evil to take lives and noble to save them. Each day I pledge to save a hundred lives. I drop my net in the lake and scoop out a hundred fishes. I place the fishes on the bank, where they flop and twirl. 'Don't be scared,' I tell those fishes. 'I am saving you from drowning.' Soon enough, the fishes grow calm and lie still. Yet, sad to say, I am always too late. The fishes expire. And because it is evil to waste anything,I take those dead fishes to market and I sell them for a good price. With the money I receive, I buy more nets so I can save more fishes.""

I take away [from his works] the compelling idea that there's serious evil in the world, and hardship and pain. And we should be humble and modest in our belief we can eliminate those things. But we shouldn't use that as an excuse for cynicism and inaction. I take away . . . the sense we have to make these efforts knowing they are hard.""—President Barack Obama Forged during the tumultuous but triumphant postwar years when America came of age as a world power, The Irony of American History is more relevant now than ever before. Cited by politicians as diverse as Hillary Clinton and John McCain, Niebuhr's masterpiece on the incongruity between personal ideals and political reality is both an indictment of American moral complacency and a warning against the arrogance of virtue. Impassioned, eloquent, and deeply perceptive, Niebuhr's wisdom will cause readers to rethink their assumptions about right and wrong, war and peace.   Read more Read less",Scribner

Most believe that Osiris is the last city on Earth. Adelaide is the black-sheep granddaughter of the city's Architect. A jaded socialite, she wants little to do with her powerful relatives--until her troubled twin brother disappears mysteriously. Vikram, a third-generation storm refugee, sees his own people dying of cold and starvation. He hopes to use Adelaide to bring about much-needed reforms--but who is using whom? As another brutal winter brings Osiris closer to riot and revolution, two very different people attempt to bridge the gap dividing the city, only to find a future far more complicated than either of them ever imagined.""--Amazon.com.

"DIMENSIONS OF UNDERSTANDING IN CROSS-CULTURAL NURSE-CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS: A QUALITATIVE NURSING STUDY (IMMIGRANTS, COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH)",Margaret Eva Osborne,mental_health,1995.0,OL12280340W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"During the last two decades European immigration to Canada has decreased while the number of immigrants from Asia and Latin America has increased (Canadian Task Force on the Mental Health Needs of Immigrants and Refugees, 1988). The potential for cross-cultural misunderstanding is evident given the differences in the explanatory models of mental health and illness between these immigrants and the dominant Canadian culture. Consequently, the health needs for this client population may be unmet and services not utilized. Even though nursing plays a major role in the provision of mental health care where nurse-client encounters are the focus of practice, there has been little published research about the cross-cultural interactional process.  The purpose of this study was to describe and explore what constitutes understanding within the cross-cultural nurse-client relationship, in the context of mental health-psychiatric nursing practice. The conceptual orientation for the study was based upon the sensitizing concepts of explanatory model (Kleinman, 1978) and caring (Watson, 1988, Gadow, 1988, Noddings, 1984).  A naturalistic, descriptive research design, incorporating multiple, intensive, semi-structured, ethnographic interviews and participant observations was used. Seven nurse-client dyads, from two community psychiatric rehabilitation programs participated in the study. Thematic analysis was used to induct dimensions of understanding in cross-cultural nurse-client encounters. The impact of the nurse's and client's explanatory models of mental health and illness on the development of understanding, and factors which facilitated or impeded the development of understanding were generated through techniques of domain analysis and constant comparison.  Study findings suggested that understanding was comprised of five dimensions. The dimensions clustered into two groups: core dimensions were behaviors which gave entry into and enabled the cultural negotiation of the care process; and secondary dimensions that were behaviors essential to supporting the facilitation of the core dimensions. Core dimensions were managing the language barrier and the exploration of explanatory models of mental health and mental illness. Essential, supportive dimensions were commitment to a human to human relationship, connecting in a culturally sensitive way and taking time. The greater the degree the dimensions existed, in interaction with each, the greater the possibility that the cultural negotiation of care goals was possible.  Three areas of relevance for nursing were: (1) the multi-dimensional, complexity of the cross-cultural interactional process; (2) further contribution to nursing's body of knowledge on caring; (3) the usefulness of the explanatory model concept in eliciting the influences of personal/professional knowing and the environment as factors impacting the development of understanding.

"Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Antihero",Jeff Pearlman,autobiography,2006.0,OL274195W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7281946M-M.jpg,"No player in the history of baseball has left such an indelible mark on the game as San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds. In his twenty-year career, Bonds has amassed an unprecedented seven MVP awards, eight Gold Gloves, and more than seven hundred home runs, an impressive assortment of feats that has earned him consideration as one of the greatest players the game has ever seen. Equally deserved, however, is his reputation as an insufferable braggart, whose mythical home runs are rivaled only by his legendary ego. From his staggering ability and fabled pedigree (father Bobby played outfield for the Giants; cousin Reggie Jackson and godfather Willie Mays are both Hall of Famers) to his well-documented run-ins with teammates and the persistent allegations of steroid use, Bonds inspires a like amount of passion from both sides of the fence. For many, Bonds belongs beside Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron in baseball's holy trinity; for others, he embodies all that is wrong with the modern athlete: aloof; arrogant; alienated. In Love Me, Hate Me, author Jeff Pearlman offers a searing and insightful look into one of the most divisive athletes of our time. Drawing on more than five hundred interviews -- with former and current teammates, opponents, managers, trainers, friends, and outspoken critics and unapologetic supporters alike -- Pearlman reveals, for the first time, a wonderfully nuanced portrait of a prodigiously talented and immensely flawed American icon whose controversial run at baseball immortality forever changed the way we look at our sports heroes.

How was your day at school?: improving dialogue about teacher job satisfaction,Nathan Eklund,psychology,2008.0,OL11994379W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16974633M-M.jpg,"Addressing the alarmingly low rate of job retention in classroom education, this guide offers practical advice to administrators and teachers for avoiding teacher burnout and increasing teacher satisfaction and performance. Since the quality of the classroom teacher is the single most important factor in predicting student success, retention of high-quality teachers is essential to student achievement. This discourse affirms that systemic change can be achieved by applying the strength-based approach of Developmental Assets® to the teacher-administrator relationship, and demonstrates the parallels between a nurturing environment for students and a nurturing environment for teachers. The common adversarial teacher-administrator dichotomy is abandoned in favor of multiple levels of accountability and change, and mutual goals for individual teachers and administrators are advanced. When every stakeholder in the school environment sees teacher job satisfaction as a win-win situation resulting in retention and higher student achievement, staff, students, and administrators can work together to build great places to teach and learn.

The authors of this book, consisting of two development economists and five practitioners, argue that the adoption of Kaizen management practices, which originated in Japan and have become widely used by manufacturers in advanced and emerging economies, is decisively the most effective first step for industrial development in Africa. This open access book discusses what Kaizen management is, why it is applicable to Africa, and why it can provide Africa with a springboard for sustainable economic growth and employment generation.

Rhyming hope and history,Russell Rook,music,2011.0,OL16518253W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"The subject of ""culture"" has provided theologians with a whole new realm of exploration. By the turn of the twentieth century and the beginning of this new milennium the subject of culture had presented itself to theologians and church leaders for vital consideration. As one of the world's leading theologians, Robert Jenson's eminent career has coincided with the pre-eminence of culture in theological and churchly discussion. Having described himself as a theologian of culture in his earliest works, culture continually informs Jenson's systematic theology, which in turn works its way out in countless cultural forms. In Rhyming Hope and History we explore the philiosophical and theological influences of Jenson's work and outline their vast and varied applications to the world of culture and the life of the church. For Jenson, the church is the cultural embodiment of the risen Christ in the fallen reality of our world. In a series of conversations between Jenson and leading thinkers, including G.W.F. Hegel, Jonathan Edwards, Wittgenstein, Richard H. Niebuhr, Kathryn Tanner, Paul Tillich, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Augustine, and Jeremy Begbie, we explore this creative and courageous proposal.

As a result, leaders ask, ""Where will the next big idea come from?"" In response, they allocate significant resources for innovation; however the source of creative inspiration has remained a mystery.   Science has shown that it's possible to create conditions under which the mind is more prepared to have insights, or ""a-ha! moments."" In this fascinating book, Andrew Razeghi examines the precursors to creative insight and offers clear-cut methods for making ""Eureka moments"" routine practice rather than lucky accidents. Combining the latest scientific research, interviews with current innovators, and studies of history's most creative minds, he dissects the creative process and presents a practical approach for inspiring innovation.

Well-nigh unfathomable problems lead to measures that seem like emergency operations on the open heart of the Western world, performed with no knowledge of the patient's clinical history. The gravity of the situation is matched by the paucity of our understanding of it, and of how it came about in the first place.  In this book, compiled from his Adorno Lectures given in Frankfurt, Wolfgang Streeck lays bare the roots of the present financial, fiscal and economic crisis, seeing it as part of the long neoliberal transformation of postwar capitalism that began in the 1970s. Linking up with the crisis theories of that decade, he analyses the subsequent tensions and conflicts involving states, governments, voters and capitalist interests--a process in which the defining focus of the European state system has shifted from taxation through debt to budgetary ""consolidation."" The book then ends by exploring the prospects for a restoration of social and economic stability. Buying Time is a model of enlightenment. It shows that something deeply disturbing underlies the current situation: a metamorphosis of the whole relationship between democracy and capitalism""--  ""The financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 still has the world on tenterhooks. The gravity of the situation is matched by a general paucity of understanding about what is happening and how it started. In this book, based on his 2012 Adorno Lectures given in Frankfurt, Wolfgang Streeck places the crisis in the context of the long neoliberal transformation of postwar capitalism that began in the 1970s. He analyses the subsequent tensions and conflicts involving states, governments, voters and capitalist interests, as expressed in inflation, public debt, and rising private indebtedness. Streeck traces the transformation of the tax state into a debt state, and from there into the consolidation state of today. At the centre of the analysis is the changing relationship between capitalism and democracy, in Europe and elsewhere, and the advancing immunization of the former against the latter""--   Read more Read less","Verso,              Verso Books"

The essay's publication unleashed a raging debate among activists in both the U.S. and Canada, a significant result of which was Michael Ryan's penning of a follow-up essay reinforcing Churchill's premise that nonviolence, at least as the term is popularly employed by white ""progressives,"" is inherently counterrevolutionary.

You forget people's names, or what you were just about to say, or why you went into the kitchen.  Often you forget where you left your keys (your wallet, your glasses, your list of Things to Do Tomorrow).  And you worry.  You wonder: Could this mean I am losing it? Join the crowd, friend.  there are seventy-eight million baby boomers in the country, and memory loss is the number one concern of the boomer generation.  The ""Worried Well,"" specialists call them.  They worry because they do not know that most memory lapses that begin in middle age are universal and normal.  Award-winning journalist Martha Lear, who gave voice to widespread frustration with medical care in her New York Times bestselling memoir Heartsounds, now explores this kind of forgetfulness--why it happens, and when, and what can be done about it.  She interviews distinguished neuroscientists, psychologists, and evolutionary biologists, as well as friends and strangers about their own memory lapses.  Interweaving dramatic new findings from brain-scan  studies with often-hilarious anecdotes, Lear covers topics as fresh and provocative as the upside of memory loss, the differences between His and Her memories, why we are actually wired to forget, and what the future holds for memory enhancement (you can't imagine what's in store).  You'll learn things you never knew before about why your memory behaves in such maddening ways.  You'll find comfort and reassurance.  And you'll probably find yourself on every page.

Clarke shows us how Taoist texts, ideas, and practices have been assimilated within a whole range of Western ideas and agendas. We see how Chinese thinkers such as Lao-tzu and Chuang tzu, along with practices such as Feng Shui and Tai Chi, have been used as a key Western inspiration in religion, philosophy, ethics, politics, ecology and health.The Tao of the West not only provides a fascinating introduction to Taoism, it also offers a timely insight into the history of the West's encounter with this ancient tradition, and into the issues arising from inter-cultural dialogue. Anyone interested in understanding the key influence Taoism has had on the West will welcome and embrace this book.   Read more Read less",Routledge

The ants shrink the children down to ant size, and the children have to live with the ants as part of the colony. Lots of information about ants; a great introduction to ant behavior. The book also has a great moral focus; reverence for life, respect for all creatures, walking in another's shoes, do unto others...etc. I loved, loved, loved this book as a child; I was fascinated with the science I was exposed to, and enchanted (and a little scared) by the idea of being the size of an ant.

Geordi LaForge and his fellow cadets are headed to Atlantis station, the underwater research base located near a volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Up until now Geordi has spent most of his life in space with his Starfleet officer parents and he is more than ready to explore this strange, new world deep underwater.    The first stop for the cadets is the above-ground complex on Isla del Fuego, where the students barely escape a small volcanic eruption. They finally arrive at the underwater station shaken and fighting among themselves, but determined to carry out their assignments.    Then suddenly an earthquake rocks the station and the cadets are trapped in their lab with tempers running high. Now, as debris blocks their path back to the aquashuttle, Geordi and the others, together, must race against time and the dangers of the freezing seawater to escape the station before it disappears into an underwater abyss!

However, Salamasca, the Empress of Ice, has plans within plans and winning one battle against the sorcererous monarch does not mean victory in the war against her evil crusade. With the help of her newly created draconian allies, her schemes take a devastatingly dangerous turn for the people of Illyander threatening to crush the land under her eldritch might. Will the bold strategy of King Morgan to attack the Queen in Snowhaven and in her place of power, the Ice Palace be enough to finally destroy the Ice Queen once and for all or has Salamasca grown powerful enough to see her plans to fruition, encasing Illyander in her icy grasp forever?

Lewis's honest reflection on the fundamental issues of life, death, and faith in the midst of loss. This work contains his concise, genuine reflections on that period: ""Nothing will shake a man -- or at any rate a man like me -- out of his merely verbal thinking and his merely notional beliefs. He has to be knocked silly before he comes to his senses. Only torture will bring out the truth. Only under torture does he discover it himself."" This is a beautiful and unflinchingly homest record of how even a stalwart believer can lose all sense of meaning in the universe, and how he can gradually regain his bearings.

Painting a compelling portrait of Microsoft's culture, this ready-to-use book encompasses the core principles that propel every Microsoft employee to excel and direct every manager's thought process. Turn to any page and you will find valuable practices and insights that can be applied to your own company.   Imagine how following these Microsoft standards could instantly increase your firm's productivity: Immediately after each project is completed, a ruthless ""post-mortem"" process ignores the project's successes to dissect its failures...and how they can be avoided in the future; Instead of wallowing in profit-induced security, Microsoft immediately begins to develop replacements for its cash-cow products - knowing that if they don't, the competition will; Smaller is not just better, it is essential, but work groups, while functionally independent, still pursue a common strategic plan; Could your company survive outside the 9-to-5 ritual? Find examples of how Microsoft's focus on task completion instead of time clocks leads to unmatched employee morale and superior effort.Can you honestly expect to build a company the size and strength of Microsoft? Possibly not...BUT by adapting Bill Gates's aggressive, common-sense strategies for use in your own company, you CAN position yourself for outstanding growth and success in today's intensely competitive, Microsoft-influenced marketplace.

REACTION OF SPOUSES TO THEIR HUSBANDS' DIAGNOSED MENTAL ILLNESS,Sonia Savitzky,mental_health,1987.0,OL12263947W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"This exploratory study used coping adaptation theory to examine the stress reactions experienced by wives of patients with a diagnosis of mental illness. In addition, this study identified ways in which psychiatric nurses could have intervened to help the wives cope more effectively with their stress.  Wives experienced a multitude of behavior difficulties related to their husbands' illness. In turn, wives reported social, economic, and psychological upheaval. Anxiety, sympathy, grief, and avoidance were the most frequent reactions of the wives to their husbands' mental illness. Older women tended to report fewer maladaptive reactions to their husbands' mental illness than younger women.  Wives attempted to reduce stress in the family by bearing alone the burden of the situation, thereby shielding younger children with lesser coping abilities. Because the traditional support mechanisms, family and friends, of many of the wives failed, the wives either expressed an interest in or were in therapy.  The majority of wives indicated that they did not consider asking the nurses for help believing that the nurses were there to help their husbands. However, wives reported that knowledge of mental illness and understanding of their situation were two types of help they would have wanted from the psychiatric nurses. Furthermore, wives indicated that nurses' aid would have been helpful in understanding mental illness, preserving their marriage, reducing tension, anxiety and friction, and gaining control over their lives.  Finally, the conclusions and implications of this study recognized the coping and adaptation used by wives in handling the mental illness of their husbands and stressed the need for therapeutic support of wives of mentally ill patients. In addition, the role of psychiatric nurses was reaffirmed in reducing environmental stress among families experiencing coping difficulties related to mental illness.   Read more Read less",

Oliver Sacks’s The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents.  If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. Sacks’s splendid and sympathetic telling, deeply human. They are studies of life struggling against incredible adversity, and they enable us to enter the world of the neurologically impaired, to imagine with our hearts what it must be to live and feel as they do. A great healer, Sacks never loses sight of medicine’s ultimate responsibility: “the suffering, afflicted, fighting human subject.”   Read more Read less",J. Curley

Owen-known to his family as ""little buddy"" or ""Little B""-has a rare genetic disorder that leaves him largely confined to a wheelchair. Before being united with Haatchi, Little B was anxious and found it difficult to make friends.  Haatchi-an adorable Anatolian Shepherd puppy-was abused and left for dead on railroad tracks. He was struck by an oncoming train, and although his life was saved, his leg and tail were partially severed. Haatchi was left massively disabled and totally dispirited.  But kind-hearted Will and Colleen Howkins, Little B's father and step-mother, decided to introduce the big dog and the little boy to each other, and an unbelievable bond was formed that transformed both boy and dog in miraculous ways.  Wendy Holden's Haatchi & Little B is the true story of an astonishing little boy, a very special dog, and the inspiring, inseparable pair that they make together.

The doctors tell her the strange and disturbing hallucinations she's been experiencing ever since her accident are all in her head, and that, with a little rest, the haunting visions will vanish. But accepting an invitation to stay with her cousin in the country may be the worst decision Meg has ever made. Here, in a remote old house miles from anywhere, the terrible sights and sounds have gotten even worse. Suddenly eerie black shapes dance in the shadows—mocking Meg, haunting her . . . threatening her.

Doctors tell him not to expect a recovery, but he believes that love can accomplish what medical science cannot. Daily he sits at her bedside, telling her stories of the precious life they have built together, hoping against hope that she will wake up. But then he discovers evidence of his wife’s secret past: a hidden first marriage to movie star Julian True.  Desperate to bring Mikaela back at any cost, Liam knows he must turn to Julian for help. But will that choice cost Liam his wife, his family, and everything he holds dear?

Bone health in children,Steven A. Abrams,nutrition,2012.0,OL16521173W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""This book provides a rational basis for understanding how to ensure adequate bone health in children. It discusses the recommended dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D in pediatric health as well as appropriate sources of these nutrients. The text presents information on the maintenance and improvement of bone health in children and adolescents. Chapters cover peak bone mass and prevention of bone loss diseases; bone formation; nutritional needs for calcium and vitamin D based on age; additional key nutrients needed for healthy bones; exercise and management of chronic illnesses; genetics and bone health; and future directions towards targeted dietary recommendations""--  ""Introduction Parents and caregivers have many concerns about their children's physical and emotional well-being when they are trying to raise healthy children. Parental concern for the potential development of osteoporosis when their children become elderly is probably not a priority during childhood. Yet, just as we now understand that heart disease and diabetes are among a whole host of adult diseases, which have their origins in childhood, we recognize that this is also true for bone health. Maintaining bone health in childhood affects our bodies both during childhood and later in life. Furthermore, establishing healthy eating patterns that will prevent osteoporosis and optimize bone health contributes to overall good nutrition; and is, therefore, a lifelong goal. Our intent in this book is to explore the recent decades of research and public commentary, as well as the mythology about bone health in children. We will address the components of bone, such as calcium, phosphorus, and other minerals. A discussion on the factors that affect these components, including vitamin D and exercise, are provided as try to separate some of the myths from the realities. At times, we will expand our discussion beyond bone issues to consider interrelated issues in pediatric nutrition. Bones are connected to the rest of the body; therefore, what children eat is not defined by just one organ system. We believe it is inappropriate to feed children based on one organ system, whether it is the heart, the bones, or even the brain. There are always choices to be made about diet, and any dietary plan must consider what is known about how foods affect each of these organ systems""--   Read more Read less",CRC Press

They’re greeted on the other end by wolf counselors Fang and Grrr (“they seem nice”), and what follows is an array of wolf activities, including learning to howl, mark, and hunt. Of course, Homer’s a little homesick at times, and the food isn’t very good, but that just makes heading home all the sweeter.   Read more Read less",Schwartz & Wade

The Edge of Winter,Luanne Rice,romance,2007.0,OL106215W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9876579M-M.jpg,"Neve Halloran and her daughter have shared a fierce love for the austere beauty of Rhode Island's South County ever since Neve guided Mickey's first baby steps along the sandy shore.  Now, with Mickey a teenager and Neve's last hope for happiness with her daughter's loving but unstable father gone, both will struggle to make a new life together amid the windswept landscape that sustains them.  Captivated by a fragile wildlife sanctuary, Mickey will move toward womanhood in the company of a lonely boy who shares her instinctive way with the creatures of the coast. And Neve will find herself drawn to a man who has devoted his life to the sanctuary, but who is unable to share the pain of a recent loss--or reconnect with the father who still bears the scars of World War II.As winter gives way to spring, and spring to summer, a secret will emerge that has lain buried in the depths just offshore for decades, a secret that will galvanize the small seaside community. For the waters bear their own vestige of the past--and their ceaseless rhythms may point the way to hope and new beginnings.  Lyrical, luminous, and utterly captivating, The Edge of Winter is Luanne Rice at her most penetrating and insightful, in a moving exploration of the bonds that shape us and set us free.From the Hardcover edition.

Dubliners,James Joyce,autobiography,1914.0,OL86320W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22165312M-M.jpg,"James Joyce's disillusion with the publication of Dubliners in 1914 was the result of ten years battling with publishers, resisting their demands to remove swear words, real place names and much else, including two entire stories. Although only 24 when he signed his first publishing contract for the book, Joyce already knew its worth: to alter it in any way would 'retard the course of civilisation in Ireland'. Joyce's aim was to tell the truth -- to create a work of art that would reflect life in Ireland at the turn of the last century. By rejecting euphemism, he would reveal to the Irish the unromantic reality, the recognition of which would lead to the spiritual liberation of the country. Each of the fifteen stories offers a glimpse of the lives of ordinary Dubliners -- a death, an encounter, an opportunity not taken, a memory rekindled -- and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation. - Back cover.  Dubliners is a collection of vignettes of Dublin life at the end of the 19th Century written, by Joyce’s own admission, in a manner that captures some of the unhappiest moments of life. Some of the dominant themes include lost innocence, missed opportunities and an inability to escape one’s circumstances.  Joyce’s intention in writing Dubliners, in his own words, was to write a chapter of the moral history of his country, and he chose Dublin for the scene because that city seemed to him to be the centre of paralysis. He tried to present the stories under four different aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life.    ‘The Sisters’, ‘An Encounter’ and ‘Araby’ are stories from childhood. ‘Eveline’, ‘After the Race’, ‘Two Gallants’ and ‘The Boarding House’ are stories from adolescence. ‘A Little Cloud’, ‘Counterparts’, ‘Clay’ and ‘A Painful Case’ are all stories concerned with mature life. Stories from public life are ‘Ivy Day in the Committee Room’ and ‘A Mother and Grace’. ‘The Dead’ is the last story in the collection and probably Joyce’s greatest. It stands alone and, as the title would indicate, is concerned with death.      Contains  Sisters Encounter Araby Eveline After the Race Two Gallants Boarding House Little Cloud Counterparts Clay A Painful Case Ivy Day In the Committee Room Mother Grace Dead      Also contained in:    Dubliners / Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man   Essential James Joyce   Portable James Joyce    Read more Read less",G.

Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management in the Western Pacific presents a full picture of the process changes used in switching from target species based management to EBFM, using a region that is at the forefront of this widely accepted movement. Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management in the Western Pacific is the outgrowth of a series of three workshops convened by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management council. The book follows the logical approach of each workshop, beginning with an assessment of the current state of fisheries management, transitioning through the data sources and modeling systems used to advance EBFM, and ending with practical methodologies for more thorough global implementation in the future. Contributed by experts from the Pacific regions as well as the UK and Non-pacific States, this book is one of the first available compendiums on this important movement and will be applicable to aquaculture scientists and researchers, fisheries managers, policy makers, and maritime social scientists worldwide""--Provided by publisher.

Lately, Andy has been especially involved in a county prison program where inmates help train dogs the Tara Foundation has rescued to make them more adoptable, benefiting both the dogs and the prisoners. One of the prisoners Andy has been working with is Brian Atkins, who has 18 months left on a 5-year term for fraud. Brian has been helping to train Boomer, an adorable fox terrier the Tara Foundation rescued from a neglectful owner. Brian and Boomer are clearly a terrific match. In fact, Andy hopes that Brian will adopt Boomer himself, once his sentence is up. But one day, Andy arrives at the prison to discover that Brian has used Boomer to make an ingenious escape, and man and dog are both in the wind. The next day, the man on whose testimony Brian was convicted is found murdered. Brian is caught and arrested for the crime, though he forcefully protests his innocence. Suddenly, Andy finds himself with a new client in Brian and a new dog in Boomer. And as he starts to dig deeper into the murder and the events leading up to it, Andy realizes he might be putting them all in far more danger than anyone had realized.   Read more Read less",

Yet even a man like Boba Fett can have one too many enemies….  When Boba Fett stumbles across evidence implicating Prince Xizor in the murder of Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle, Fett makes himself an enemy even he fears: the unknown mastermind behind a monstrous deception, who will kill to hide his tracks. Fett also finds himself in possession of an amnesiac young woman named Neelah, who may be the key to the mystery—or a decoy leading Fett into a murderous ambush. Fett's last hope is to run through the list of Xizor's hidden enemies. And since Xizor's hidden enemies are almost as legion as Fett's, the chance of survival is slim—even for someone as skilled and relentless as Boba Fett.   Read more Read less",Spectra

It contains candid interviews with dozens of astronomers, geologists, biologists, and writers about the origin and range of terrestrial life and likely sites for life beyond Earth. The interviewees discuss what we've learnt from the missions to Mars and Titan, talk about the search for Earth clones, describe the surprising diversity of life on Earth, speculate about post-biological evolution, and explore what contact with intelligent aliens will mean to us.

He'd envisioned a world of tough-talking detectives and smart-mouthed, stunning dames. Instead he saw case after case of cheating husbands, suspicious wives and unsuspecting mistresses... until she walked through the door.Right down to her stilettos, Mae Sullivan was a knockout with a lethal body--and a lethal family to go with it. There was something not quite on the up-and-up about her, but she came with a case he couldn't afford to refuse...and left him with a case of lust he hadn't had since high school. It didn't take long for him to fall for her, hook, line and sinker. But was Mae interested only in catching the double-crossing crooks who murdered her uncle...or did the lady want to catch him?

Coggeshall (1824-1867) was a journalist and publisher, and editor of The Genius of the West, a literary magazine in Cincinnati. He served as State Librarian of Ohio from 1856 to 1862.  The editor wrote in his Preface that it was his intention to include in the collection every person “…legitimately belonging to the West, who has gained recognition as a writer of reputable verse.” It contains selections, with biographical notices, from the writings of 97 men and 55 women. 60 were residents of Ohio, 23 of Indiana, 14 of Kentucky, 13 of Illinois, 5 of Michigan and 4 of Wisconsin. Not more than 10 of these poets pursued literature as a profession. The volume contains poems from about 1815 to the early 1860s.  The book is very substantial in size and the biographies are sometimes surprisingly detailed. Entries are in chronological order, and the first ones contain valuable background detail about the early literary life of Cincinnati.   Read more Read less","Follett, Foster"

Most of these systems were designed to support business architectures that have changed dramatically. At best, these systems hinder agility and competitiveness and, at worst, can bring critical business functions to a halt. Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) restores the value of entrenched systems by capturing and retooling various aspects of existing application environments, allowing old infrastructures to deliver renewed value and align effectively with enterprise strategies and business architectures. This book provides a practical guide to organizations seeking ways to understand and leverage existing systems as part of their information management strategies. It includes an introduction to ADM disciplines, tools, and standards as well as a series of scenarios outlining how ADM is applied to various initiatives. Drawing upon lessons learned from real modernization projects, it distills the theory and explains principles, processes, and best practices for every industry. * Acts as a one-stop shopping reference and complete guide for implementing various modernization models in myriad industries and departments. * Every concept is illustrated with real-life examples from various modernization projects, allowing you to immediately apply tested solutions and see results. * Authored by the Co-chair of the Object Management Group (OMG) Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) Task Force, which sets definitive systems modernization standards for the entire IT industry. * A web site supports the book with up to date coverage of evolving ADM Specifications, Tutorials, and Whitepapers, allowing you to remain up to date on modernization topics as they develop.

Margaret Mead and Samoa,Derek Freeman,anthropology,1983.0,OL1913530W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7350665M-M.jpg,"“In 1928 Margaret Mead announced her stunning discovery of a culture in which the storm and stress of adolescence do not exist. COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA has since become a classic - and the bestselling anthropology book of all time. Within me nature-nurture controversy that still divides scientists, Mead’s evidence has long been a crucial “negative instance,” an apparent proof of the sovereignty of culture over biology.    In MARGARET MEAD AND SAMOA, Professor Freeman presents startling but wholly convincing evidence that Mead’s proof is false. On the basis of years of patient fieldwork and historical research, Freeman refutes Mead’s characterization on of Samoan society and adolescence point for point. Far from the relaxed transition to adulthood that Mead ascribed to permissive childrearing and tolerant sexual attitudes, Samoan adolescence, Freeman demonstrates, is a time of frequent stress in an authoritarian society with punitive methods of childrearing and restrictive regulations against premarital sex. Freeman’s book thus corrects a towering scientific error. His aim is not to blame Margaret Mead but to understand how her error could have occurred and become basic to the doctrine of cultural determinism. The result is a detective story in the history of science, one filled with engrossing details about cultural anthropology’s battle with the eugenics movement, about Mead’s relationships with her most important colleagues, Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas, and finally about her poor preparation for the field and the likelihood that she was duped by her adolescent informants. Beyond these particulars lie painful but important generalizations about how the truth in science can sometimes be obscured by theory and how theory can sometimes be twisted by ideology.” BOOK JACKET.

They are looking for statesmanship. In this book, Newell examines noted Americans at seven critical turning points in American history to look at what it takes to be a statesman. Through a powerful speech and the events preceding and following it, they show us how they grappled with conflicting values, varying demands, and the uncertainties of trying to forge a good society. This book is aimed at practicing leaders--and students of leadership""--  ""Americans hunger for statesmanship. They seek leaders who will respond to problems by putting the nation's long-term needs ahead of partisanship and personal gain. We have faced this need before, and leaders came forward with acts of statesmanship. We can learn from them. Statesmanship, Character and Leadership in America explores what seven leaders at turning points in American history said and did. Their character and ability to manage the context of their times, craft a transcendent purpose, practice artful politics, exercise compelling persuasion and call forth high moral values from the American people offer ideas and techniques for leaders today""--   Read more Read less",Palgrave Macmillan

As cooking unlocked the memories of her rough-and-tumble childhood and the loss and heartbreak that came with it, Martin became more determined than ever to find peace and elevate her life through the prism of food and world cultures. From the tiny, makeshift kitchen of her eccentric, creative mother, to a string of foster homes, to the house from which she launches her own cooking adventure, Marin's heartfelt, brutally honest memoir reveals the power of cooking to bond, to empower, and to heal--and celebrates the simple truth that happiness is created from within""--   Read more Read less",

Looking back with post-9/11 vision, ""too far"" was a mere two years ahead of its' time.  Biohazard is an eyeopening autobiography of Ken Alibek, AKA Kanatzhan (Kanat) Alibekov, a leading bio weapons developer and Soviet officer of Kazakh ancestry who was determined to expose the former Soviet Union's extensive covert biological weapons program in the 1990's.    It was first published by Hutchinson in the United Kingdom in 1999, then re-released by Arrow Books in 2000.  Filled with equal parts terrifying details about the gigantic military bio weapons research operation in Russia and of mundane life in the oppressive former Soviet Union, Biohazard was widely dismissed by so-called ""experts"" upon its' release as sensationalist baloney, nothing more than a mass of outright lies. The facts and allegations Alibek was putting forth about the magnitude of the illegal weapons research the Soviet Union was doing at that time could have led directly into World War III, but for the most part it was never recognized for what it was until long after he had been published in England.  Most of the book's assertions have since been investigated and confirmed by U.S. and other Western microbiological and bio weapons authorities. Visits to the laboratory and weapons production sites have confirmed the majority of the pathogens and the level of research performed there. The vast Soviet Union biological weapons infrastructure dwarfed any known bio weapons program anywhere else, and makes for a truly disturbing read.   Read more Read less",

Innovating organization and management,Nicolai J. Foss,success_in_business,2011.0,OL15980905W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24885989M-M.jpg,"""The search for competitive advantage serves as the basis for organizational strategy. This book argues that there are four key sources of competitive advantage and financial success that have not been given the attention they deserve. Firstly, that organizational design and management processes may be strategic resources in their own right. Secondly, that organizational design and management processes can be deployed to create new strategic resources. Thirdly, that managers have begun to think of organizational design and management processes in a proactive way rather than seeing them more passively as necessary facilitators of success. Fourthly, that this new way of looking at organization and management requires a search for new ways of structuring organizational design and managerial processes. These points are driven home through case studies of the Danish firms LEGO Group, Vestas Wind Systems, Coloplast, Chr. Hansen, IC Companys and NKT Flexibles""--  ""The dominant thinking in strategic management stresses the importance of assets, such as reputation, intellectual property rights, and relations with suppliers and customers. Less attention has been dedicated to organizational design and new management processes. However, the above discussion highlights the fact that such designs and processes can serve as strategic resources for firms. In other words, if they are properly organized and deployed, such resources can contribute decisively to corporate success. Thus, they contribute to the value the company can create and the value it can appropriate. They also help to make sure that the focal firm's level of appropriated value is higher than that of the competition. As mentioned above, management academics have only recently begun to put their academic talents to use in the analysis of management innovation. Therefore, the ways in which management innovations and improvements in organization and management processes can contribute to competitive advantage are far from fully understood""--   Read more Read less",Cambridge University Press

A foodie and former chef, Franklin wants to pass on her love of food and cooking to her kids; she wants them not only to enjoy what they’re eating but to know what they’re eating. So, over the course of a year, she introduces her children to new dishes—some exotic, some thrown together with whatever she has in her cabinets—with varying degrees of success. Undaunted by failure (“This tastes like sand!”), Franklin pursues her culinary mission from the heartland of Indiana to the Umbrian countryside. Some meals conjure visions of pleasure while others are utter catastrophes. Along the way, she discovers how a delicious (or even disastrous) meal can bring families together and feed the soul.As Franklin chronicles her family’s year around the kitchen table, season by season, she shares original recipes. From comfort, kid-friendly food like Mummy Nuggets, to the more adventurous Saffron Fish Chowder, to food made on the fly like Orange-Oaty-I-Don’t-Know Cookies, each recipe follows a charming or bittersweet or laugh-out-loud anecdote that captures the chaos of cooking for four young kids.Franklin seasons her stories with how-I-did-it advice on cooking and parenting that makes this such a delightful and inspiring read. And with more than 100 simple, mouthwatering dishes, Too Many Cooks is a happy mix of recipes, memories, and good storytelling.   Read more Read less",Voice

The last thing handsome, aristocratic Saxon Blackwell needs is a bride. But a cruel ultimatum from his wicked witch of a grandmother leaves him with no choice but to seek one or lose his vast English estate forever. Saxon’s flight from high society leads him right into the arms of Chickadee McBride—a barefoot, flame-haired mountain girl with a saucy tongue, a tender heart and her very own wolf.  Both shocked and secretly intrigued by the untamed beauty’s scandalous behavior, the cynical Saxon quickly decides Chickadee would make the perfect bride to bring home to grandmother. Chickadee’s Scotch-Irish temperament and irresistible shenanigans set society ablaze with gossip, but it is Saxon who finds his body burning with a passion he can no longer deny.

Like his fellow artists from the Düsseldorf School of Photography (Becher School) such as Candida Höfer, Andreas Gursky, or Thomas Struth, Hütte stands for the tableau character of the photographic image as an equivalent counterpart of painting. Axel Hütte's artistic work started out in the late 1970s with stark objectification of the reality of portraits as well as urban interiors and exteriors. In the early 1990s, the artist turned to considerably larger picture sizes, with landscape becoming his dominant theme. Unlike his earlier documentary pictures, the more recent large-format works have more of an imaginative and hallucinatory dimension. Exhibition: Kunsthalle Krems, Austria (11 03.-10.06.2018).

Henry Pratt chupó con fuerza el pitillo y lo ladeó en la boca. Evidentemente no se sentía contento ni feliz. Ingrid era demasiado tolerante con Helen y hasta con Ann, que debiera estar en la Universidad en aquel instante y en cambio la oía canturrear en el jardín.     — Lo eres—dijo el caballero con voz alterada—. Lo eres aunque creas lo contrario, Helen se ha creído siempre una princesa encantada y ahora que es mujer sigue pensando lo mismo. Y he de evitarlo.     — Estoy esperando que me digas cómo lo vas a hacer — rió suavemente la dama.    Henry volvió a quitar el cigarrillo de la boca y esta vez lo tiró por la ventana. Se oyó un grito y en seguida apareció la bonita cabeza de Ann en el quicio de la ventana.     — Papá —dijo enfadada—, otra vez procura avisar cuando tires las puntas de tus cigarros.""

A partir de entonces, esa niña desorientada y perpleja, que reza en silencio para volverse niño porque presiente que jamás conseguirá parecerse a su hermana melliza, Reina, la mujer perfecta, empieza a sospechar que no es la primera Fernández de Alcántara incapaz de encontrar el lugar adecuado en el mundo. Se propone entonces desenmarañar el laberinto de secretos que late bajo la apacible piel de su familia, una ejemplar familia burguesa madrileña. A la sombra de una vieja maldición, Malena aprende a mirarse, como en un espejo, en la memoria de quienes se creyeron malditos antes que ella y descubre, mientras alcanza la madurez, un reflejo de sus miedos y de su amor en la sucesión de mujeres imperfectas que la han precedido.

It's been six weeks since Magnus and his friends returned from defeating Fenris Wolf and the fire giants. Magnus has adjusted to life at the Hotel Valhalla—as much as a once-homeless and previously alive kid can. As a son of Frey, the god of summer, fertility, and health, Magnus doesn't exactly fit in with the rest of Odin's chosen warriors, but he has a few good peeps among his hallmates on floor nineteen, and he's been dutifully training for Ragnarok along with everyone else. His days have settled into a new kind of normal.  But Magnus should have known there's no such thing as normal in the Nine Worlds. His friends Hearthstone and Blitzen have disappeared. A new hallmate is creating chaos. According to a very nervous goat, a certain object belonging to Thor is still missing, and the thunder god's enemies will stop at nothing to gain control of it.  Time to summon Jack, the Sword of Summer, and take action. Too bad the only action Jack seems to be interested in is dates with other magical weapons. . .

Grand Theft Jesus,Robert S. Mcelvaine,religion,2008.0,OL8294270W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL10353702M-M.jpg,"""Jesus never wrote a book, but I recognize his handwriting in Grand Theft Jesus. Like Jesus, McElvaine uses lively illustrations and a serious sense of humor to cleanse the temple of exclusive and exploitative religion."" --The Reverend Alan Storey,Calvary Methodist Church, South Africa""We're mad as Heaven, and we're not going to take it anymore!"" declares historian Robert McElvaine in this passionate and often hilarious rallying cry for sincere Jesus Followers. He lets the rest of society know that the extreme right wing won't be allowed to speak for all Christians any longer. His whip-smart, take-no-prisoners polemic lays bare the Christian Right's ""Easy Jesus"" creed, in which people who claim to accept Jesus get a free pass to lie in his name. Grand Theft Jesus exposes the televangelists and the leaders of megachurches as the people Jesus warned us about--the wolves in sheep's clothing of our day.The religion that McElvaine calls ChristianityLite resembles schemes that promise ""Lose weight without diet or exercise!"" Its leaders say, ""Be saved without sacrifice or good works!"" Run by a crew of politicians, megachurch preachers, televangelists, hypocrites, and snake-oil salesmen, it has hijacked true Christianity and distorted it into something Jesus wouldn't recognize. Its leaders have taken the generous and loving ideals of Christ and twisted them into a religion that advocates war and intolerance, values money above charity, preaches hatred instead of brotherhood, and promises ""true"" believers the keys to the gates of the kingdom of God--and to the bank vault. Jesus' radical message of love and peace has been drowned out by the bluster, the hate, and the selfishness that often passes for Christianity in America. McElvaine names names in his list of ""Leading Lites"" who have earned spots on Jesus' Ten Most Unwanted List and exposes the hypocritical (Ted Haggard), the disgraceful (Pat Robertson), and the shocking (Ann Coulter). Grand Theft Jesus blends outrage and humor in a compelling argument that will help to resurrect the real Jesus, who has been crucified and interred by the ""Right Reverends"" who recite the Apostles' Greed, are pro-choice on wars of choice, and preach the Greater Gory of Christ.From the Hardcover edition.

It is simply a matter of knowing which quadrant to work from and when. Have you ever wondered . . .7 What is the difference between an employee and a business owner? 7 Why do some investors make money with little risk while most other investors just break even? 7 Why do most employees go from job to job while others quit their jobs and go on to build business empires7 Why, in the Industrial Age, did most parents want their children to become medical doctors, accountants, or attorneys . . . and why, in the Information Age, are these professions under financial attack? Have you noticed that many of the brightest graduates from our universities want to work for college dropouts . . . dropouts such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Michael Dell, and Ted Turner? Dropouts who today are the mega-rich of society.

Time was,Steve Perry,fantasy,1998.0,OL2215818W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL464258M-M.jpg,"Annabelle Donohoe, the CEO of World Tech, is mad as hell.  Her dreams of world domination died the day Zac Robillard discovered her evil plans and fled World Tech, taking his greatest creation, his beloved I-Bots, and all his research, with him. (Read about their origins in Isaac Asimov's History of I-Bots!) More than super-machines, more than robots, the I-Bots are eerily  human in appearance, but not in abilities. Their genetic components--based on human DNA--and mechanical infrastructures give them pshyical strength and powers humans can only imagine, and a measure of free will impossible in robots.  Annabelle wants them back and will stop at nothing to get her way, including hiring the world's deadliest assassin to find Zac, and his I-Bots--the beautiful Radiant and Killaine,  clever Itazura, Psy-4, and Stonewall--and bring them in...or kill them. For if Annabelle cannot have the I-Bots she vows that no one else can either. But Janus, the ruthless killer, is not the only hunter they must elude...Surrounded by enemies, Zac and the I-Bots can find no safe place, not even the streets. In the year 2013, the Silver  Metal Stompers, a neo-Nazi gang, roam the nation's cities wreaking havoc on robots, especially Scrappers, outmoded homeless robots who huddle in hobo camps, rusting away unless they are repaired by a mysterious humanitarian and robotarian called DocScrap. In an unlucky twist of fate, the Stompers discover DocScrap is none other than Zac Robillard and that the I-Bots aren't exactly human...and vow to crush Zac and the I-Bots into wreckage.  Based on an original concept by Isaac Asimov, Time Was is a nonstop action adventure combining all the excitement of Golden Age SF with the technological wonders of modern cybernetics and quantum science.  This remarkable collaboration between the greatest science fiction genius of all time and a team of brilliant young writers is a major publishing event. Only the Grand Master himself could have foreseen the awesome wonders depicted in Isaac Asimov's I-Bots. And only today's finest storytellers could have brought them so vividly to life.

""The day every person on earth lost his and her memory was not a day at all. In people's minds there was no actual event. . . and thus it could be followed by no period of shock or mourning. There could be no catharsis. Everyone was simply reset to zero."" On Day Zero, the collapse of civilization was as instantaneous as it was inevitable. A mysterious and oppressive movement rose to power in the aftermath, forcing people into isolated communes run like regimes. Kayle Jenner finds himself trapped on a remote beach, and all that remains of his life before is the vague and haunting vision of his son. . . Kayle finally escapes, only to find a broken world being put back together in strange ways. As more memories from his past life begin returning, the people he meets wandering the face of a scorched earth--some reluctant allies, others dangerous enemies--begin to paint a terrifying picture. In his relentless search for his son, Kayle will discover more than just his lost past. He will discover the truth behind Day Zero--a truth that makes both fools and gods of men""--   Read more Read less","Talos Press,              Talos"

Today, the fundamental importance of the cultivation and preservation of identity is finally re-emerging. In this book, Rodney Barker explores the rich fabric of speech, dress, diet and the built environment from which human identity is made. The colour of a scarf or the accent of a conversation can unite people or divide them, and the smallest detail can play its part in signalling who are allies and who are enemies. Identity simultaneously generates equality and inequality – it is both the engine of public life and the cause of its confusion and conflict – and a better understanding of its subtleties is crucial if we are to confront the tensions that it produces in society.  Synthesising methods and ideas from numerous disciplines – including history, political science, anthropology, law and sociology – Barker presents a picture of human life as more than just a collection of material interests. His ultimate aim is to show that no human activity is trivial or meaningless, that everything counts and plumage matters.""   Read more Read less",Manchester University Press

"British Fascist antisemitism and Jewish responses, 1932-40",Daniel Tilles,political_science,2014.0,OL23192447W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL31026490M-M.jpg,"""British Fascist Antisemitism and Jewish Responses, 1932-40 explores the use of antisemitism by Britain's interwar fascists and the ways in which the country's Jews reacted to this. It analyses these issues in far greater breadth and depth than any previous study and examines the two alongside one another for the first time.Daniel Tilles challenges existing conceptions of the antisemitism of Britain's foremost fascist organisation, the British Union of Fascists (BUF). He demonstrates that antisemitism was a far more central aspect of the party's thought than has previously been assumed, one that had been present from the outset and was inseparable from - indeed integral to - its ideological goals. Moreover, he argues that the BUF's leader, Sir Oswald Mosley, far from being a reluctant convert to the anti-Jewish cause, or simply a cynical exploiter of it, as much of the existing scholarship suggests, was aware of the role antisemitism would play in his fascist doctrine from the start and remained in control of its subsequent development. These insights are in turn used to support the notion that, contrary to prevailing perceptions, Jewish opposition to the BUF played no real part in provoking the fascists' adoption of antisemitism. Britain's Jews did, nevertheless, play a vital role in shaping British fascism's path of development, and the wide-ranging and effective anti-fascist activity they pursued represents an important alternative narrative to the dominant image of Jews as mere victims of fascism""--   Read more Read less",Bloomsbury Publishing Plc

Twenty Chickens for a Saddle,Robyn Scott,autobiography,2008.0,OL9324609W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL29040801M-M.jpg,"A glorious new voice on Africa, Robyn Scott's adventures growing up in Botswana in a loving but eccentric family will be one of the season's most talked-about memoirs Robyn Scott's story of moving at the age of seven to Botswana with her adventure-seeking parents is described by Alexander McCall Smith as ""beautifully written"" and ""acutely observed. "" It is that and more. Twenty Chickens for a Saddle is an exquisitely rendered portrait of Africa, and of childhood, written by an astonishing new talent. The Scotts are truly one of the most unusual families you are likely to meet. Robyn's father is a flying doctor who always wanted to be a vet. Her mother believes in holistic medicine and homeschooling. Both are deeply eccentric, and under their affectionate but relaxed guidance, life for the children is a daily adventure of the kind usually confined to storybooks. Storybooks-or being read to from them-comprise, it turns out, most of their homeschooled education. That, and searching the surrounding bush for animals (poisonous and otherwise) to let loose in their schoolroom. As a result of the absolute freedom of spirit, thought, and movement that they are given, all three children grow into fascinating, if rather eccentric, characters in their own right. When the family moves to a game farm bordering South Africa, the children become more aware of the darker undercurrents of life in Africa. Here the apartheid mind-set lives on in many of their white South African neighbors. And when at fourteen Robyn begins conventional school in neighboring Zimbabwe, she sees more of the racism initially only glimpsed in Botswana. AIDS also rears its head. Long witnessed by Robyn's father at his village clinics, the existence of the disease is acknowledged by the government too late-only as death, on an unprecedented scale, begins to devastate this peaceful and prosperous African country. Robyn Scott is an extraordinarily gifted writer and storyteller. Like the witch doctors who compete with her father for patients, she weaves a spell from the start. Her funny, moving memoir, told with clear-eyed unsentimental affection, is about an idyllic childhood and a family's enthusiasm for each other and the world around them, with the essence of Africa-both beautiful and challenging- infusing every page.

Satanic Feminism,Per Faxneld,religion,2017.0,OL21156140W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28640728M-M.jpg,"According to the Bible, Eve was the first to heed Satan's advice to eat the forbidden fruit and thus responsible for all of humanity's subsequent miseries. The notion of woman as the Devil's accomplice is prominent throughout Christian history and has been used to legitimize the subordination of wives and daughters. In the nineteenth century, rebellious females performed counter-readings of this misogynist tradition. Lucifer was reconceptualized as a feminist liberator of womankind, and Eve became a heroine. In these reimaginings, Satan is an ally in the struggle against a tyrannical patriarchy supported by God the Father and his male priests. Per Faxneld shows how this Satanic feminism was expressed in a wide variety of nineteenth-century literary texts, autobiographies, pamphlets, newspaper articles, paintings, sculptures, and even artifacts of consumer culture like jewelry. He details how colorful figures like the suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, gender-bending Theosophist H. P. Blavatsky, author Aino Kallas, actress Sarah Bernhardt, anti-clerical witch enthusiast Matilda Joslyn Gage, decadent marchioness Luisa Casati, and the Luciferian lesbian poetess Renée Vivien embraced these reimaginings. By exploring the connections between esotericism, literature, art and the political realm, Satanic Feminism sheds new light on neglected aspects of the intellectual history of feminism, Satanism, and revisionary mythmaking.

Ostensibly, the club is a place to gather with old friends, hunt, eat, drink, and talk off-the-record about war, life, death, sex and politics.   But one Fall weekend, the Executive Board of the Custer Hill Club gathers to talk about the tragedy of 9/11 and what America must do to retaliate.  Their plan is finalized and set into motion.That same weekend, a member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force is reported missing.  His body is soon discovered in the woods near the Custer Hill Club's game reserve.  The death appears to be a hunting accident, and that's how the local police first report it, but Detective John Corey has his doubts.  As he digs deeper, he begins to unravel a plot involving the Custer Hill Club, a top-secret plan known only by its code name: Wild Fire.  Racing against the clock, Detective Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, find they are the only people in a position to stop the button from being pushed and chaos from being unleashed.

Mean markets and lizard brains,Terry Burnham,finance,2005.0,OL222507W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24264992M-M.jpg,"Everyone from journalists to market pros are turning to behavioral finance to explain, analyze, and predict market direction. In contrast to old-school assumptions of cool-headed rationality, the new behavioral school embraces hot-blooded human irrationality as a core feature of both individuals and financial markets. The 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to scholars of this new scientific approach to irrationality. In Mean Markets and Lizard Brains, Terry Burnham, an economist who has a proven ability to translate complex topics into everyday language, reveals the biological causes of irrationality. The human brain contains ancient structures that exert powerful and often unconscious influences on behavior. This ""lizard brain"" may have helped our ancestors eat and reproduce, but it wreaks havoc with our finances. Going far beyond cataloguing our financial foibles, Dr. Burnham applies this novel approach to all of today's most important financial topics: the stock market, the economy, real estate, bonds, mortgages, inflation, and savings. This broad and scholarly investigation provides an in-depth look at why manias, panics, and crashes happen, and why people are built to want to buy at irrationally high prices and sell at irrationally low prices. Most importantly, by incorporating the new science of irrationality, readers can position themselves to profit from financial markets that often seem downright mean. Mean Markets and Lizard Brains skillfully identifies the craziness that is part of human nature, helps us see it in ourselves, and then shows us how to profit from a world that doesn't always make sense.

But he will give you a sizable piece of his mind on Election Year 2000. This plain-talking, name-naming, podium pounding populist zeros in on everything that ails us, from the global economy and media to big business and election winners everwhere. In his hardhitting commentary and hilarious anecdotes, Hightower spares no one, including the sacred cows, -and especially the politicians--who helped steer us into this mess in the first place. An equal opportunity muckraker and a conscientious agitator for ""We the People,"" Hightower inspires us to take charge again, build a new politics for a better tomorrow--and have a lot of laughs along the way.

Famous and beloved during her lifetime all over Latin America and in Europe, Mistral has never been known in North America as she deserves to be. The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalized into a ""poetess"" of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendor of her Hymns of America.

When life coach RenÉe Stephens was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome after a lifetime of obsessive compulsive eating, she realized it was time to make some radical changes in her life. Stephens had tried every kind of diet and weight-loss plan on the market, but it was only when she looked inside and overhauled her spiritual life that she found the solution. Now, for the first time in print, Full-Filled shares the invaluable, breakthrough lessons she learned.  With a six-week program that yields insights every day of the journey, Full-Filled brings readers deep inside their relationship to eating, pinpoints trigger foods and situations, and develops a whole bag of tips, tricks, and self-awareness tools to uncover deeper emotional cravings and find better ways to satisfy their wants and needs without food. In the first and second weeks, readers learn how to motivate themselves for long-lasting change and put an end to self-sabotage. In the third and fourth weeks, they learn the value of ""screwing up"" and move toward self-forgiveness and self-acceptance. By week five, readers will enjoy eating for pleasure and, in the final week, Stephens helps them put it all together to stay slim and healthy for a lifetime.  Through her Inside-Out weight-loss program and seminars, along with podcasts downloaded more than 3 million times, Stephens has helped countless people free themselves from emotional eating. With Full-Filled, she brings her unique therapeutic approaches and motivational program to everyone who's ready to lose weight--and keep it off for good""--   Read more Read less",Free Press

Following two generations of masked crime-fighters from the end of World War II to the height of the Cold War, this compelling tale unfolds from a simple murder mystery into an epic saga of power, corruption and the ultimate meaning of humanity. More than 30 years after it was first published, Moore and Gibbons' masterpiece continues to inspire and entertain readers around the world.

Fixing failed states,Ashraf Ghani,political_science,2009.0,OL19668677W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Today between forty and sixty nations, home to more than one billion people, have either collapsed or are teetering on the brink of failure. The world's worst problems--terrorism, drugs and human trafficking, absolute poverty, ethnic conflict, disease, genocide--originate in such states, and the international community has devoted billions of dollars to solving the problem. Yet by and large the effort has not succeeded. Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart have taken an active part in the effort to save failed states for many years, serving as World Bank officials, as advisers to the UN, and as high-level participants in the new government of Afghanistan. In Fixing Failed States, they describe the issue--vividly and convincingly--offering an on-the-ground picture of why past efforts have not worked and advancing a groundbreaking new solution to this most pressing of global crises. For the paperback edition, they have added a new preface that addresses the continuing crisis in light of ongoing governance problems in weak states like Afghanistan and the global financial recession. As they explain, many of these countries already have the resources they need, if only we knew how to connect them to global knowledge and put them to work in the right way. Their state-building strategy, which assigns responsibility equally among the international community, national leaders, and citizens, maps out a clear path to political and economic stability. The authors provide a practical framework for achieving these ends, supporting their case with first-hand examples of struggling territories such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo and Nepal as well as the world's success stories--Singapore, Ireland, and even the American South.  The authors provide a practical framework, contrasting struggling territories such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo and Nepal with success stories like Singapore and Ireland.

It has three parts reflecting the past, present and future of a woman, Anna P, who lives on an island off the coast of Italy but can no longer remember how she got there. She comes from South Africa but has almost no memories of the place or people there, and no attachment to them. The only person she has any relationship with is a sex worker whom she pays by the hour. Her life is meaningless. She has abusive encounters with unknown men, clearly repetitions of traumatic events in the past, during which she dissociates. It is not clear whether she occasionally kills these men or not. It is only when she begins to connect emotionally with a slightly retarded child, and her self begins to coagulate around a tiny centre core of meaning, that she finds some value in herself, some place which she will not allow to be abused. Through connection with another person, she comes into an ethical relationship with the world."" -- Description from thesis.   Read more Read less","Jacana,              Jacana Media"

In language that is suggestive and often erotic, Nathaniel Hawthorne tells a tale of failed possibilities and multiple personal betrayals as he explores the contrasts between what his characters espouse and what they actually experience in an 'ideal' community. A theme of unrealized sexual possibilities serves as a counterpoint to the other failures at Blithedale: class and sex distinctions are not eradicated, and communal work on the farm proves personally unrewarding and economically disastrous. Based in part on Hawthorne's own experiences at Brook Farm, an experimental socialist community, The Blithedale Romance is especially timely in light of renewed interest in self-sufficient and other cooperative societies.

Light on the Indian World,Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa),religion,2002.0,OL8745512W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8442005M-M.jpg,"This book combines for the first time the most important writings of Ohiyesa (Charles Eastman), the first Native American author to live simultaneously in both the traditional world of the Santee Sioux and the modern civilization of the white man.Ohiyesa's works represent the most complete explanation of the philosophy and moral code of the Plains Indian. Providing much of the basis of our knowledge of their sacred world view in which 'we are all related', they sound a profoundly spiritual note which speaks directly to the ecological crisis and the de-humanization of man so often discussed in our time. On a deeper level, Ohiyesa's message speaks to every person who seeks a spiritual way in the midst of a society increasingly dominated by materialism and industrial technology. It was around the turn of the Twentieth Century that he wrote, ""It is my personal belief, after thirty-five years' experience of it, that there is no such thing as 'Christian civilization.' I believe that Christianity and modern civilization are opposed and irreconcilable, and that the spirit of Christianity and of our ancient religion is essentially the same.""Ohiyesa's prophetic voice speaks now across three centuries with an urgency which is still fresh and original. Not only should students of Native American philosophy carefully read this book, it should be essential reading for all people who search the ancient worlds for light to better understand the problems which press upon us today. Editor Michael Fitzgerald has written and edited many publications on American Indian spirituality, including Yellowtail: Crow Medicine Man and Sun Dance Chief, which he recorded and edited and which was first published in 1991 by the University of Oklahoma Press (now in its fifth printing).  Prior to his death in 1993, Yellowtail made many visits to Fitzgerald's home in Bloomington, Indiana. And, for over 30 years Fitzgerald has spent extensive amounts of time each summer visiting various American Indian tribes throughout the Plains and the Southwest and has attended sacred rites of the Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne, Shoshone and Apache tribes.He is also the editor of the best selling, Indian Spirit (World Wisdom, 2003).In addition, Fitzgerald has taught Religious Traditions of the North American Indians in the Indiana University Continuing Studies Department at Bloomington, Indiana. He holds a BA, magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, and a JD, cum laude, from Indiana University.Mr. Fitzgerald has been an adopted member of the Thomas Yellowtail family and the Crow tribe since 1972.

Comfort Woman is the story of Akiko, a Korean refugee of World War II, and Beccah, her daughter by an American missionary. The two women are living on the edge of society—and sanity—in Honolulu, plagued by Akiko's periodic encounters with the spirits of the dead, and by Beccah's struggles to reclaim her mother from her past. Slowly and painfully Akiko reveals her tragic story and the horrifying years she was forced to serve as a ""comfort woman"" to Japanese soldiers. As Beccah uncovers these truths, she discovers her own strength and the secret of the powers she herself possessed—the precious gifts her mother has given her.A San Francisco Chronicle bestsellerIn 1995, Nora Okja Keller received the Pushcart Prize for ""Mother Tongue"", a piece that is part of Comfort Woman.

We re-visit the issue using modern portfolio theory.  We examine the set of investment opportunities available to British investors, the developments in information transmission technology, and advances in financial and investment theory at the time.  We use mean-variance optimization techniques to take into account the risk and return characteristics of domestic and international investments available to a British investor, and to quantify the beneifts from international diversification.  Evidence suggests that capital export was a consequence of both the opportunity and the understanding of diversification.  foreign assets offered higher rates of return, but equally important, they offered significant diversification benefits.  Even when--by setting expected return on each foreign asset class equal to that of the corresponding UK asset class--we put foreign assets at a disadvantage, we find that it was rational for a British investor to include foreign debts and equity in the portfolio""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

But if chasing down bail jumpers, adulterous spouses, and workmen's comp cases seemed like the dregs of the PI game, it was at least a living. Not as much could be said for tracking down a man like Will ""the Ghost"" Stirman.The stone-cold killer has just staged a bloody escape from the Floresville State Penitentiary with a gang of violent cons as spooked by Stirman as those on the outside who helped put him behind bars. And no one seems more worried than Navarre's boss and mentor, Erainya Manos. It was her husband along with rival PI Sam Barrera who built the case that sent Stirman away. But Erainya's husband is dead and she's certain Stirman won't let that stand in the way of his taking revenge against her and her adopted son.All of Navarre's instincts are screaming that there's more to this case than meets the eye. But Erainya won't tell him--and Sam Barrera seems to be escaping into a strange twilight from a truth too terrible to remember. That leaves Tres to dig into a twisted mystery of greed, vigilantism, and murder, where lives are bought and sold and the line between guilt and innocence is razor-thin. Meanwhile, Stirman and his gang are coming, leaving behind them a trail of brutal, unforgiving violence that will end in an area of San Antonio known as Southtown--but that may soon just as well be called hell on earth.From the Hardcover edition.

Loop,mathematics,2009.0,OL16742736W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25398484M-M.jpg,"Do you want to present math from a biblical perspective, but need ideas and a framework from which to start? Are you looking for fresh inspiration for your math class? Building on the principles presented in Beyond Numbers, this manual will help you modify and fill in the gaps in your curriculum. In Revealing Arithmetic, you'll get ideas and inspiration to help you: Reinforce a biblical worldview and worship the Lord in math; Teach your children to really understand concepts and think mathematically as opposed to merely memorizing mechanics; Transform everyday activities and objects into math lessons, teaching your child to use math as a real-life tool; Make and use an abacus in your teaching, as well as explore other historical methods and symbols that help children really view math as a tool and better understand our modern method. This book is usable with a variety of grades and learning styles. Concepts covered range from counting to exponents (view the Table of Contents), making it appropriate for supplementing a pre-K through about grade 6 curriculum. Since math builds on itself, students in even older grades can also use the book as a review to help them get a firm foundation for upper-level concepts. Because of the format and structure, you can easily take or modify the information for your particular child's ability and interests. Includes examples of modifying a typical curriculum presentation. Each chapter (with the exception of counting) walks through modifying a typical curriculum presentation, illustrating ways you could modify your textbook to convey the principles and goals discussed. - Publisher.

And trained in all the forms of death-dealing combat, she took to the road in search of her enemies.  She was Kethry.

Coping with the impending delivery of her second child as well as a staff shortage, the last things Joanna needs are two serious crimes.First, the body of an unidentified man is found in the desert, all of his fingers savagely severed. Following the scant clues, Joanna learns that the victim was an ex-con who had served twenty years in prison after confessing to the murder of his pregnant wife. During his last days he was seen following and photographing a young woman.Then one of Joanna's officers is brutally attacked and left for dead while on an unau-thorized stakeout.

Her job is to avenge man's inhumanity toward man, and finding out who the victim was and why he is dead is what she has been summoned to do with her life.

Only the land of Khel remains uncommitted to Bhayar's rule. Their decision could mean a lasting peace, or more conflict across an already war-ravaged realm. While the conqueror of Bovaria awaits emissaries to arrive with news of Khel's decision, other weighty matters occupy Bhayar, his sister Velora, and her husband Quaeryt--not the least of which is the fulfillment of Quaeryt's dream to create the world's first Imager academy, where the magical abilities of these powerful casters may be honed, managed, and put to the service of the common good.

Guerrero was born into a wealthy family in Guanajuato, Mexico, in 1882. While still a young man, he renounced his inheritance, claiming that he would rather earn his meals through manual labor than secure them by exploiting his fellow human beings. Within less than a decade, he was a central figure in the transnational revolutionary network established by the Organizational Council of the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM), which was dedicated to deposing the dictator Porfirio Díaz and promoting anar­chist revolution throughout Mexico. He was killed in battle at the age of twenty-eight in 1910.  Guerrero was also one of the most prolific and talented revolutionary writ­ers of his era, penning numerous articles that were known for both their literary style and their polemical force. In this volume, editor and translator Javier Sethness-Castro has collected a wide range of Guerrero’s work for the newspapers Revolucíon, Punto Rojo, and Regeneracíon, most of them appear­ing for the first time in English. This edition also includes a biographical introduction and helpful annotations throughout.   Read more Read less",AK Press

SOCIAL SUPPORT AND SELF-EFFICACY AS MEDIATORS BETWEEN STRESS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN OLDER ADULTS,Eunlee Chung,mental_health,1995.0,OL12280148W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"The purpose of this study was to extend the current understanding of relationships among stress, social support, and depressive symptoms of older persons by exploring: (1) the ways in which different types of stressors affect depressive symptoms, (2) the degree to which effects of stressors are mediated by various dimensions of social support, and (3) the mechanism through which social support comes to affect older individuals' depressive symptoms.  The study included stress (negative life events, physical disability, financial strain), various social support elements (social networks, emotional support from significant others, support provided to others), perceived self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms in order to explain the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms in older persons and the degree to which this relationship is mediated through social support and individuals' perceptions of self-efficacy. In particular, it examined the causal relationship between social support and self-efficacy to understand the psychological mechanism through which social relationships affect the well-being of older people.  The study included 925 noninstitutionalized elderly subjects from a 1986 national survey entitled Americans' Changing Lives. Path analysis was used to test the proposed relationships of stress, social support, self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms in the elderly. As hypothesized, stress--negative life events, physical disability, and financial strain--exerted significant effects on depressive symptoms of elderly persons. In addition, the present study demonstrated the following: (1) the effect of negative life events on depressive symptoms was reduced by mobilized social networks or contacts as well as support from important others, (2) physical disability and financial strain further increased depressive symptoms of elderly persons by deteriorating their social networks or contacts, (3) physical disability and financial strain contributed further to increase depressive symptoms by depleting older persons' perceptions of efficacy, and (4) the impact of negative life events on depressive symptoms was reduced by social support from important others and the subsequent positive effect of social support on feelings of self-efficacy in the elderly. The study findings provided useful insight into nursing practice, particularly in planning therapeutic approaches aimed at improving older people's feelings of self-efficacy and supportive social interactions. Limitations of the study and directions for future research were also noted.   Read more Read less",

Now Blaine and a small group of fellow exiles have returned to a lawless wasteland, where unrestrained magic storms wreak havoc and monsters roam free. Yet, amidst the chaos, rumors persist of a new magic that could restore the kingdoms. But the key lies with a dangerous, ancient ritual and a group of vanished survivors.

History, literature, theology and the dynamic of a living, worldwide religious reality, all appropriately impinge on the study of Jesus. The two parts of the book roughly correspond to the interdependent tasks of historical description and critical and theological reflection. It incorporates the most up-to-date historical work on Jesus the Jew with the 'bigger issues' of critical method, the story of Christian faith and study, and Jesus in a global church and in the encounter with Judaism and Islam. Written by seventeen leading international scholars, the book encourages students of the historical Jesus to discover the vital contribution of theology, and students of doctrine to engage the Christ of faith as Jesus the first-century Jew.

From the British Library to the Mohegan Sun casino, from the nation’s first synagogue to a Mayflower waterslide, Vowell studies the Puritan effect and finds their beliefs about church and state more interesting than their buckles-and-corn reputation would suggest.She asks:Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, Christlike Christian, or conformity’s tyrannical enforcer? Yes! Was Rhode Island’s architect Roger Williams America’s founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? Same difference. How come Henry Vane the Younger, who argued against beheading the English king, was himself beheaded for helping behead said king? Good question. What does it take to get that jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? A hatchet. What was the Puritans’ pet name for the Pope? The Great Whore of Babylon. What is the lesson of the Pequot War? Why, don’t fire one of your military’s embarrassingly few Arabic translators just because he’s gay, of course.As in all Vowell’s bestselling books, this exploration of America’s past is both poignant and entertaining. The Wordy Shipmates is rich with historical fact, humorous insight, and social commentary by one of America’s celebrated voices.   Read more Read less",Riverhead Books

Ma Taffy may be blind but she sees everything. So when her great-nephew Kaia comes home from school in tears, what she senses sends a deep fear running through her. While they wait for his mama to come home from work, Ma Taffy recalls the story of the flying preacherman and a great thing that did not happen. A poor suburban sprawl in the Jamaican heartland, Augustown is a place where many things that should happen don't, and plenty of things that shouldn't happen do. For the story of Kaia leads back to another momentous day in Jamaican history, the birth of the Rastafari and the desire for a better life""--   Read more Read less",
For Bea,Kristen Von Kreisler,dogs,2004.0,OL8960100W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8816515M-M.jpg,"A touching and humorous account of the author's fifteen years with her beagle, Bea, a refugee from an animal research laboratory.Harried by recent upheavals in her life, the last thing Kristin von Kreisler needed was another dog. But when she came upon Bea, a scrawny beagle abandoned by the roadside, she couldn't turn away. Bea became part of her family, and changed it forever.Disheveled, malnourished, and terrified of human contact, Bea seemed damaged beyond repair. But, gradually, she began to trust von Kreisler. After resisting her touch again and again, the dog one day leaned in and nuzzled her neck. From that moment, Bea began to give love as well as receive it. With the typically unforgettable personality of a beagle, over the next decade and a half she taught von Kreisler the value of living utterly in the present, of meeting each day with a good bark, and of moving forward in life without being dragged down by past grief.Written with rare eloquence and down-to-earth wit, this memoir of Bea and von Kreisler's fifteen-year love story will charm ""beaglers"" and touch the heart of anyone who has ever loved a dog.

But no one realizes that radical social agendas have also taken over campus health and counseling centers, with dire consequences.Psychiatrist Miriam Grossman knows this better than anyone. She has treated more than 2,000 students at one of America's most prestigious universities, and she's seen how the anything- goes, women-are-just-like-men, ""safer-sex"" agenda is actually making our sons and daughters sick.Dr. Grossman takes issue with the experts who suggest that students problems can be solved with free condoms and Zoloft. What campus counselors and health providers must do, she argues, is tell uncomfortable, politically incorrect truths, especially to young patients in their most vulnerable and confused moments.

Charles Tripp's erudite and incisive book considers one of the most significant challenges faced by Muslims over the last sixty years: the challenge of capitalism. By reference to the works of noted Muslim scholars, the author shows how, faced by this challenge, these intellectuals devised a range of strategies which have enabled Muslims to remain true to their faith, whilst engaging effectively with a world not of their own making. The work is framed around the development of their ideas on Islamic socialism, economics and the rationale for Islamic banking. While some Muslims have resorted to confrontation or insularity to cope with the challenges of modernity, most have aspired to innovation and ingenuity in the search for compromise and interaction with global capitalism in the twenty-first century.

These results concern an n-dimensional generalization of the three-dimensional elasticity which, aside from leading to a great many interesting mathematical situations, often shed light on certain aspects of the three-dimensional case. The book begins with a brief introduction to some general concepts, in order to show how the boundary value problems studied in the text arise. This is followed by the development of some technical material needed in the rest of the book. Subsequent chapters are devoted to obtaining theorems of existence, uniqueness and analytic dependence on the load, near special deformations for boundary value problems of place, and traction in finite elastostatics.

Bush at the helm, one that transcends politics to provide an inside look at the hands-on specifics of Bush’s aggressive yet pragmatic leadership style. This fast-paced yet powerful book explains how the Bush model can be used by any executive to streamline management and decision processes—and establishes a new standard for results-oriented leadership in the 21st century.Get the inside story on George W. Bush’s leadership techniques and tactics, and how they can be used to drive performance in virtually any setting, in Team Bush.Praise for Team Bush:“This short book is long on insight, both for government leaders seeking to learn leadership lessons from effective CEOs and for business leaders seeking to learn the same lessons from effective leaders in government.”—Steven Kelman, Weatherhead Professor of Public Management, The John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University“Kettl provides a lively, insightful and sympathetic distillation of the surprisingly effective leadership style of President George W. Bush.”—Thomas E. Mann, W. Averell Harriman Chair in Governance Studies, The Brookings Institution“Management matters, in politics and government as much as in business and commerce. In clear language and with a slew of examples, Team Bush concisely dissects the management style that has helped President George W. Bush to sustain his public approval and achieve both political and policy success.”—Norman J. Ornstein, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute“If I have any genius or smarts, it’s the ability to recognize talent, ask them to serve, and work with them as a team.”—George W. BushPresident George W. Bush forged his team-based leadership style in the world of private enterprise. Before becoming our nation’s first MBA president (Harvard, 1975), “W” had developed his own style of talking with and listening to team members, making decisions based on their input, and then relying on his team to carry out those decisions. It was a style tailor-made for the presidency.Team Bush explores the mind and methods of America’s 43rd president. Bypassing theory and jargon to focus on Bush’s hands-on decision making standards and practices, this compelling leadership resource reveals:The President’s decide-and-delegate style of leadership, adapted from the pages of Harvard MBA textbooks Techniques Bush used to build one of history’s most talented cabinets, and how he tailors his communication style to fit that of each member How Bush helped his party retain the House and recapture the Senate in his first mid-term election—a feat almost unheard of by a sitting president Beyond the conference rooms of the White House, however, Team Bush explains how executives can use Bush’s model to streamline decision-making and boost productivity in virtually any arena. This fast-moving leadership manual discusses the value of receiving accurate, unfiltered information from close advisors, and how to establish a chain of communication for receiving that information. It explains the value of limiting goals to those that are essential, and devising methods to make them achievable. It explores the importance of developing a meaningful plan and sticking with that plan, regardless of distractions and delays.   Read more Read less",McGraw-Hill

Hardy – eccentric, charismatic and considered the greatest British mathematician of his age – receives a mysterious envelope covered with Indian stamps. Inside he finds a rambling letter from a self-professed mathematical genius who claims to be on the brink of solving the most important mathematical problem of his time. Hardy determines to learn more about this mysterious Indian clerk, Srinivasa Ramanujan, a decision that will profoundly affect not only his own life, and that of his friends, but the entire history of mathematics. Set against the backdrop of the First World War, and populated with such luminaries as D.H. Lawrence and Bertrand Russell, The Indian Clerk fashions from this fascinating period an utterly compelling story about our need to find order in the world.

And yet, as Marcus Buckingham astutely points out, even though the strengths-based approach is now conventional wisdom, the tools and systems inside organizations-performance appraisals, training programs, and succession planning systems-remain stubbornly remedial, exclusively focused on measuring skills, finding gaps, and attempting to plug them. It's a crisis for individuals and organizations, with management ideas and management practice utterly out of sync. That's about to change. StandOut 2.0 is a revolutionary book and tool that enables you to identify your strengths, and those of your team, and to act on them. The original StandOut provided top-notch management insights from one of the world's foremost authorities on strengths, as well as access to a powerful, cutting edge online assessment tool. Now, in addition to a much more powerful assessment, and a robust report on your most dominant strengths, StandOut 2.0 provides: - A StandOut profile, easily customized and exported, that you can use to present the very best of yourself to your team, and your company - Your own Personalized Strengths Channel, which, after taking the 15 minute assessment, will send you a weekly tip, insight, or technique, to help you do your best work this week - For team leaders, the ability to create a team dashboard including each member's StandOut profile, to help you make the right moves - Access to an entire strengths-based performance management system, including a check-in tool to capture priorities and track engagement; a survey tool to help you gauge what your team is thinking and feeling; and an evaluation tool to help reveal real-time performance levels of every single team member StandOut 2.0 is your indispensable guide and tool for building on your strengths to further your career, and to help your team and organization win""--   Read more Read less",Harvard Business Review Press

Except for the body in the oak grove, shot in the back. The victim was a visitor to the town. Mary McGill and her cocker spaniel Millie had seen him only that morning, staring in the window of Lowell's jewellery store, his German Shepherd, Ranger, at his side. Could the diamond and sapphire necklace which caught his attention have some connection with his untimely death? What brought him to Santa Louisa in the first place? Having agreed to look after Ranger temporarily, Mary is unwillingly drawn into the murder investigation.

Introduced by ""poetry DJ"" Catherine Bowman, these popular short segments allowed listeners to experience poetry as a kind of verbal music, recalling its roots as a spoken art form.  Word of Mouth, edited by Bowman, brings together the poems that have been featured on NPR, providing a window onto the dynamic contemporary poetry scene. A child playing with flashes of sunlight in the aisle of an airplane; a woman describing tropical fruit to someone in a faraway country; a man building a deck with his dead father's hammer; the musings of a Barbie doll participating in a 12-step program: these poems powerfully and lyrically transform the stuff of every day life. A celebration of the poetic voice that includes 33 acclaimed writers, this vibrant anthology proves beyond any doubt that poetry is far more than just words on paper.Quincy Troupe  -  Czeslaw Milosz  - Campbell McGrath  -  C.D.

What is meant by the idea of being democratic seems, however, to be anything but clear. Is it only a question of representing the people through elections, ballots, and political parties, or does it include institutional culture, the division of powers, and the legal regime within a community? A ""philosophy of the republic"", as developed in this volume's contributions, shows that the current ""dominance of the democratic"" falls short of accounting for the independent significance to the republican self-organisation of state and society.

What would we do if a terrorist organization announced that it had concealed nuclear weapons in ever major western city and then demanded that the entire planet embrace its twisted brand of Muslin fundamentalism?  In Critcal Mass, nuclear interdiction expert James Deutsh and his tormented Muslim wife, Nabila, struggle to stop an impending nuclear attack on an American city. Along the way, they delve deep into the hidden world of nuclear terrorism and the experts who strive to contain it, and get a compelling look at the titanic battle within Islam over its own future--fundamentalist and rejecting, or compassionate and life-embracing?  Like Whitley Strieber's classics Warday and The Coming Global Superstorm, Critical Mass is torn straight from the dark pages of a very dangerous and very possible future.   Read more Read less",Forge

Three years into Ontario's Common Sense Revolution, hospitals and schools are closing by the hundreds; thousands of nurses and teachers and other workers are jobless; schools are in chaos; pregnant welfare mothers have lost their nutrition allowance because the Premier thinks they'll spend it on beer; Toronto the megacity is collapsing under the weight of its own amalgamated administration; the Premier's last cultural experience was Mr. Silly; the rich are getting larger tax cuts while the province won't spring to bury the homeless; and welfare recipients deserve to be fingerprinted, but motorists running red lights shouldn't have their pictures taken because it would violate their privacy. What can you do but laugh? That's the approach taken by Linwood Barclay, who's been skewering the current occupiers of Queen's Park in his Toronto Star column since they took office.

Labour Migration in Malaysia and Spain,Blanca Garcés-Mascareñas,anthropology,2012.0,OL20933696W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28360791M-M.jpg,"State regulation of labour migration is confronted with a double paradox. First, while markets require a policy of open borders to fulfill demands for migrant workers, the boundaries of citizenship impose some degree of closure to the outside. Second, while the exclusivity of citizenship requires closed membership, civil and human rights undermine the state's capacity to exclude foreigners once they are in the country. By considering how Malaysia and Spain have responded to the demand for foreign labour, this book analyses what may be identified as the trilemma between markets, citizenship and rights. For though their markets are similar, the two countries have different approaches to citizenship and rights. We must thus ask: how do such divergences affect state responses to market demands and how, in turn, do state regulations impact labour migration flows? And what does this mean for contemporary migration overall?   Read more Read less",

It has become apparent that developing a better operational plan is needed.  To improve disaster relief, better logistics planning, which also requires better forecasting methods, is needed.  Furthermore, to increase collaboration at all levels, it is also necessary to have more reliable communication technologies and a better information technology structure which will enable better coordination between different agencies.  Utilizing technologies such as GIS and real-time tracking systems will ensure that the available disaster relief stocks will be distributed fairly to everybody.

From getting dumped and having no one to kiss on New Year's Eve, to the nightly news, frivolous lawsuits, Jar Jar Binks, and, yes, even mosquitoes, Things that Suck flows with all the unpleasantries that rank high and low on the Kaplan scale of suckage. Lauded by New York Magazine as surprisingly perceptive, Things that Suck calls attention to examples of suckitude such as: The morning commute Your driver's license photo Overly perky people People who think they're great at British accents The kid kicking the back of your seat That kid's parentsThink of this book as company for your misery, or as an intriguing way to understand the complicated world we've created and the complex variety with which it screws us over each and every day. Whether you've experienced schadenfreude (deriving pleasure from another's misfortune), or you've simply had a no-good, very bad, terrible day, take comfort with Kaplan's compendium, Things that Suck, and realize things aren't so dreadful after all.

A producer for Britain's most popular morning show working under a nightmare boss, Tash is well-versed in the trials and tribulations of twenty-first century dating. She and her three best friends certainly haven't lived the fairy tale they thought they would: there's Andy, who's hooked on passion, but too much of a tomboy to have moved much beyond the beer-drinking contest stage; Mel, stuck in a steady but loveless relationship; and Emma, endlessly waiting for her other half to propose. Their love lives are only complicated by the sort of men who seem to drift in and out: Andrew--suave, good-looking and head over heels in love . . . with himself; Simon, who is allergic to commitment but has a bad-boy nature that's impossible to resist; and Adam--perfectly attractive, but too sweet to be sexy. The bestselling first novel that launched Jane Green, one of the brightest stars in contemporary women's fiction, Straight Talking sets the record straight regarding the real world of dating, and follows the adventures of Tash and her friends as they search for fulfillment and the right kind of love.  Funny, flirty, and ultimately tender, Straight Talking gets at the heart of modern romance.   Read more Read less","Random House of Canada, Limited"

Do you strive for higher income, but at the same time sense there's more to success than making lots of money? Do you long to pursue your purpose in a meaningful and rewarding way? Even though you've already achieved a great deal, do you deeply desire, definitely deserve, and fully expect to reap even greater financial rewards--and want to ensure you handle those financial rewards knowledgably and responsibly?  Sacred Success is a groundbreaking paradigm shift that tells women, There is a better way to achieve wealth and power: on your own terms.  In her work with countless powerful, successful women over the last twenty years, bestselling author and financial educator Barbara Stanny found that most women's problems with money have little to do with money itself, but rather their fear of or ambivalence toward power. Instead of pushing women to pursue financial success in the traditional fashion, Sacred Success seeks to redefine power from a feminine perspective.  You can be financially successful without sacrificing your soul or compromising your values. You can have more money, not as an end itself, but as a tool for making a difference and helping others. You can create wealth and exercise power by staying true to your feminine traits, authentic truths, and personal mission.  The ultimate goal of Sacred Success isn't to ""finish rich"" (though that may be a desired outcome), but to achieve Greatness, which requires you to become the powerful force you were born to be.  More than a financial guide, Sacred Success is a primer on power for women--a tutorial for taking charge of your life by taking charge of your finances, and not only growing your money but creating a deeper, richer, and more meaningful life. Best described as A Course in Miracles meets the Wall Street Journal, Sacred Success gives you a proven process that uniquely blends the practical, psychological, and spiritual work of wealth.  The results may be nothing short of miraculous""--   Read more Read less","BenBella Books, Inc."

Surprised by beauty,Robert R. Reilly,music,2002.0,OL5968347W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3576716M-M.jpg,"The single greatest crisis of the 20th century was the loss of faith. Noise--and its acceptance as music--was the product of the resulting spiritual confusion and, in its turn, became the further cause of its spread. Likewise, the recovery of modern music, the theme to which this book is dedicated, stems from a spiritual recovery. This is made explicitly clear by the composers whose interviews with the author are collected in this book. Robert Reilly spells out the nature of the crisis and its solution in sections that serve as bookends to the chapters on individual composers. He does not contend that all of these composers underwent and recovered from the central crisis he describes, but they all lived and worked within its broader context, and soldiered on, writing beautiful music. For this, they suffered ridicule and neglect, and he believes their rehabilitation will change the reputation of modern music. It is the spirit of music that this book is most about, and in his efforts to discern it, Reilly has discovered many treasures. The purpose of this book is to share them, to entice you to listen--because beauty is contagious. English conductor John Eliot Gardiner writes that experiencing Bach's masterpieces ""is a way of fully realizing the scale and scope of what it is to be human"". The reader may be surprised by how many works of the 20th and 21st centuries of which this is also true [Publisher description]   Read more Read less",Morley Books

Long Hedge,Jason West,business__economics,2014.0,OL21083037W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""Part of the Greenleaf Publishing Responsible Investment Series. Mitigating and adapting to risks and changing circumstances is a natural part of doing business. But methods of mitigating and adapting can be quite different in terms of time, cost and observed impacts. The impacts of mitigation activities are more immediate while the benefits of adaptation activities may take many years to take effect. Nowhere is this difference more apparent than in the case of the corporate response to climate change. In the context of climate change, adaptation is the process of changing behaviour in response to actual or expected climate change impacts. Climate change adaptation is now emerging as a critical partner to mitigation, and indeed may even become the primary protection mechanism for future generations. In this unique book, Jason West provides a comprehensive assessment of the management of climate change adaptation in the corporate sector. The book provides a formal overview of the range of approaches available along with a series of practical case studies and examples that can be used by companies and other organizations to identify, assess and manage climate change adaptation. A major focus is on the financial and investment implications of climate change adaptation. West examines how firms can evaluate the investment decisions associated with long-term climate change adaptation measures, including how such investments can be valued and funded, the appropriate accounting treatment of such measures and appropriate risk management and governance practices in relation to such measures. The book also considers the needs and interests of investors and other stakeholders, and considers how they can assess the adequacy and appropriateness of corporate action on climate change. The Long Hedge will be essential reading and a key text for risk-practitioners, investors, financiers, scholars and policy makers in the field of climate change.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",Taylor and Francis

The simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The 15 leading causes of premature death -- illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and others -- claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to help prevent or fight these diseases and to live longer. In addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top 15 causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen, a checklist of the foods and activities we should try to incorporate into our daily routines. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting-edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives. - Jacket flap.

Giberson,design,2012.0,OL16444340W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25158786M-M.jpg,"Like detectives sleuthing out the greatest mystery of all, scientists over the centuries have uncovered clues about the structure and origins of the universe. The work of Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and a host of other tenacious researchers and thinkers reveals a cosmos of almost unimaginable wonder and beauty. If we then honestly follow the evidence of science wherever it leads, where do we end up? Karl Giberson takes us on a fascinating guided tour of planets and protons, galaxies and gamma rays. We discover that if gravity were slightly stronger, neutrons a tiny bit lighter, the size of our sun somewhat larger or a dozen other factors altered by fractions, there would be no life. The author shows that for many observers, even those who do not embrace religious faith, all of this looks suspiciously like the expression of a grand plan -- a cosmic architecture capable of both supporting life such as ours, and inspiring observers like us to seek out hints of a creator. Join this cosmic expedition and discover the wonder of it all. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",IVP Books

How did Ragweed and Poppy meet and become friends? This book tells their hilarious story! Adventurous golden mouse Ragweed is on a freight train leaving the city of Amperville. On his journey he meets Lotar, a young, annoying, and lost raccoon who’s desperate to reunite with his mother. Though Ragweed doesn’t really want to help the raccoon, by doing so he winds up in Dimwood Forest.  Ragweed is now ready to strike off on his own, but it’s not long before he hears a cry for help. Following the sound of the voice, he finds a cage with a deer mouse trapped inside. When he asks the mouse’s name, she replies, “Poppy.”  The way Ragweed comes to Poppy's aid, and how Poppy comes to his, is how their rousing and fateful friendship begins. As for that annoying raccoon, he keeps getting in the way.  Fans of animal stories and especially of the beloved previous books in the Poppy series will love Ragweed and Poppy!

Anomalies in estimates of cross-price elasticities for marketing mix models,Andre Bonfrer,mathematics,2006.0,OL12233533W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""We investigate the theoretical possibility and empirical regularity of two troublesome anomalies that frequently arise when cross-price elasticities are estimated for a set of brands expected to be substitutes.  These anomalies are the occurrence of: (a) negatively signed cross-elasticities; and (b) sign asymmetries in pairs of cross price elasticities.  Drawing upon the Slutsky equation from neoclassical demand theory, we show how and why these anomalies may occur when cross elasticities are estimated for pairs of brands that are substitutes.  We empirically examine these issues in the context of the widely used Multiplicative Competitive Interaction (MCI) and Multinomial Logit (MNL) specifications of the fully extended attraction models (Cooper and Nakanishi 1988).  Utilizing a database of store-level scanner data for 25 categories and 127 brands of frequently purchased branded consumer goods, we find that about 18% of a total of 732 cross elasticity estimates are negative and approximately 40% of the 366 pairs of cross elasticities are sign asymmetric.  Finally, we find that the occurrence of negatively signed cross elasticities can be partially explained by a set of hypothesized relationships between cross-price elasticities and brand share and elasticities of income and category demand""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Buddhist-Christian dialogue as theological exchange,Ernest M. Valea,religion,2015.0,OL22946675W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""This book is intended to encourage the use of comparative theology in contemporary Buddhist-Christian dialogue as a new approach that would truly respect each religious tradition's uniqueness and make dialogue beneficial for all participants interested in a real theological exchange. As a result of the impasse reached by the current theologies of religions (exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism) in formulating a constructive approach in dialogue, this volume assesses the thought of the founding fathers of an academic Buddhist-Christian dialogue in search of clues that would encourage a comparativist approach. These founding fathers are considered to be three important representatives of the Kyoto School--Kitaro Nishida, Keiji Nishitani, and Masao Abe--and John Cobb, an American process theologian. The guiding line for assessing their views of dialogue is the concept of human perfection, as it is expressed by the original traditions in Mahayana Buddhism and Orthodox Christianity. Following Abe's methodology in dialogue, an Orthodox contribution to comparative theology proposes a reciprocal enrichment of traditions, not by syncretistic means, but by providing a better understanding and even correction of one's own tradition when considering it in the light of the other, while using internal resources for making the necessary corrections."" --   Read more Read less",Pickwick Publications

Covering critical areas, such as credit or default risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, Shari'ah risk, and displaced commercial risk, the volume describes risk analysis and mitigation with respect to both contract and overall bank regulations. Using financial statements from a simulated Islamic bank, including balance sheets, income statements, and profit distribution models, Rania Abdelfattah Salem explains this integrated risk-management process in practice and investigates the application of risk regulatory insights in banking policy. She outlines a risk coding system to facilitate risk management and reporting systems, and she compares different risk management scenarios across a number of conventional and Islamic banks.

Through close textual readings, the book problematizes how an unstable and aporic setting at the same time enables and invalidates recent discursively over-invested Virginian interpretations and refutes the by now institutionally orthodox view that Caliban is a character of credible New World origin. The book calls for a utopian understanding of the play's vacuum of power and interprets pastoral, anarchic, and Americanist tensions through a presentist, post-1989 lens""--   Read more Read less",Palgrave Macmillan

Now his discovery of a dead ranch hand is bringing his demons home.As a doctor and a sheriff, Jake's witnessed death in all its dark guises -- and he recognizes a murder when he sees one.

The politics of nation building and citizenship in Singapore,"Hill, Michael",political_science,1995.0,OL3509602W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1110129M-M.jpg,"Since independence in 1965 Singapore has strengthened its own national identity through a conscious process of nation-building and promoting the active role of the citizen within society. Singapore is a state that has firmly rejected welfarism but whose political leaders have maintained that collective values, instead of those of autonomous individuals, are essential to its very survival.The book begins by examining basic concepts of citizenship, nationality and the state in the context of Singapore's arrival at independence. The theme of nation-building is explored and how the creation of a national identity, through building new institutions, has been a central feature of political and social life in Singapore. Of great importance has been education, and a system of multilingual education that is part of a broader government strategy of multiculturalism and multiracialism; both have served the purpose of building a new national identity. Other areas covered by the authors include family planning, housing policy, the creation of parapolitical structures and the imporatnce of shared 'Asian values' amongst Singapore's citizens.

The principles include several weather experiments, a great section on gyroscopes, a section on steam power, and several experiments showing how sound can be studied, as well as many other fascinating ways to learn scientific methods and have great fun. While the book is about ninety years old, the experiments can still teach effectively.

The Wild West hits the East Coast when Welch’s Annual Rodeo and Wild West Show arrives in Bayport. Frank and Joe are enjoying the show’s historic reenactments, rodeo events, and even an exhibition of the Welch family’s prize-winning horse, Hondo.  When the brothers catch several ranch hands trying to steal Hondo, they manage to stop it. Though very grateful for their intervention, the Welch family is now shorthanded for the cattle drive back to their dude ranch! So Chief Olaf “volunteers” the Hardys to help out.  The brothers’ long-dormant horse-riding skills slowly come back to them as they make their way down the quiet rural roads toward the ranch. But as they’re finally getting the hang of it, a group of dirt bike–riding cattle rustlers surround the herd—and take Hondo!

Key to his scheme are the Neimoidians of the Trade Federation. Then one of his Neimoidian contacts disappears, and Sidious does not need his Force-honed instincts to suspect betrayal. He orders his apprentice, Darth Maul, to hunt the traitor down.  But he is too late. The secret has already passed into the hands of information broker Lorn Pavan, which places him right at the top of Darth Maul’s hit list. Then, in the labyrinthine alleyways and sewers of Coruscant, capital city of the Republic, Lorn crosses paths with Darsha Assant, a Jedi Padawan on a mission to earn her Knighthood. Now the future of the Republic depends on Darsha and Lorn.

The surprising truth is that the only way to truly scale your company is to reduce its reliance on you. This means that, done right, you get growth without sacrificing your life. Jeff Hoffman and David Finkel offer a concrete road map to rapidly grow your existing business while also gaining more freedom. You'll learn the three core elements to create a stable base from which to scale (systems, team, and internal controls), how to pick the best strategy to get smart growth, and how to remove the predictable obstacles to scaling pillar by pillar inside your business. Plus you'll also get practical, proven advice on how to execute in the face of conflicting demands and multiple responsibilities. By breaking down the path to scaling into seven principles, any business owner can increase profits and their own freedom""--   Read more Read less",Portfolio Hardcover

This is why expectations-based management has been developed. Outperform with Expectations-Based Management (EBM) introduces a revolutionary new performance metric that links performance standards, performance measurement, and the achievement of performance.   It's easy to say that if a CEO can get performance measurement right, then performance improvement will follow.

Seven Metaphors on Management: Tools for Managers in the Arab World,F. Muna,management,2017.0,OL32327893W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""This title was first published in 2003. This text covers seven management metaphors that have been of great value to the author and his clients over the years in his roles as a father, manager and management trainer. Some chapters contain checklists or guidelines for action; others have short hypothetical case studies woven into the writing. These demonstrate either the principle ideas or how to use the metaphors as managerial tools. Many of the anecdotes and examples used in the book are drawn from the author's personal experience and consulting assignments in the West and the Arabian Gulf. The book is written with the practicing manager in mind. It contains many references to well-known publications but does not have an academic tone. In brief, the book summarizes up-to-date research findings and trends on a number of people management topics. It also describes the trends in management styles and practices in the Arabian Gulf over a period of 30 years, based on field research carried out in 1980, 1989 and 2002""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",Taylor and Francis

Now, in 59 Seconds, he fights back, bringing together the diverse scientific advice that can help you change your life in under a minute, and guides you toward becoming more decisive, more imaginative, more engaged, and altogether more happy.From mood to memory, persuasion to procrastination, resilience to relationships, Wiseman outlines the research supporting the new science of ""rapid change"" and, with clarity and infectious enthusiasm, describes how these quirky, sometimes counterintuitive techniques can be effortlessly incorporated into your everyday life.

Deterministic and Stochastic Optimal Control,Wendell H. Fleming,mathematics,1975.0,OL4303581W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL5203484M-M.jpg,"This book may be regarded as consisting of two parts. In Chapters I-IV we pre­ sent what we regard as essential topics in an introduction to deterministic optimal control theory. This material has been used by the authors for one semester graduate-level courses at Brown University and the University of Kentucky. The simplest problem in calculus of variations is taken as the point of departure, in Chapter I. Chapters II, III, and IV deal with necessary conditions for an opti­ mum, existence and regularity theorems for optimal controls, and the method of dynamic programming. The beginning reader may find it useful first to learn the main results, corollaries, and examples. These tend to be found in the earlier parts of each chapter. We have deliberately postponed some difficult technical proofs to later parts of these chapters. In the second part of the book we give an introduction to stochastic optimal control for Markov diffusion processes. Our treatment follows the dynamic pro­ gramming method, and depends on the intimate relationship between second­ order partial differential equations of parabolic type and stochastic differential equations. This relationship is reviewed in Chapter V, which may be read inde­ pendently of Chapters I-IV. Chapter VI is based to a considerable extent on the authors' work in stochastic control since 1961. It also includes two other topics important for applications, namely, the solution to the stochastic linear regulator and the separation principle.

She discusses everything - from how much she hates her purse to how much time she spends attempting to stop the clock: the hair dye, the treadmill, the lotions and creams that promise to slow the aging process but never do. Oh, and she can't stand the way her neck looks. But her dermatologist tells her there's no quick fix for that. Ephron chronicles her life as an obsessed cook, passionate city dweller, and hapless parent. She recounts her anything-but-glamorous days as a White House intern during the JFK years (""I am probably the only young woman who ever worked in the Kennedy White House that the President did not make a pass at"") and shares how she fell in and out of love with Bill Clinton - from a distance, of course. But mostly she speaks frankly and uproariously about life as a woman of a certain age.   Read more Read less",ISIS

"Hello, robot",Christoph Thun-Hohenstein,design,2017.0,OL19725228W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""Hello, Robot. Design between Human and Machine"" investigates how robotics is increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives. The exhibition shows that design in its traditional function as a mediator is indispensable if robots are to become a visible reality and not just remain hidden in washing machines, cars and cash machines. The catalogue points out where we already encounter these intelligent machines and where we may come across them in the near future: in the industry, in the military and in everyday settings; at nurseries and retirement homes; in our bodies and in the cloud; when shopping and having sex; in video games and, of course, in film and literature. In a series of in-depth essays and interviews, experts such as science-fiction author Bruce Sterling or the design duo Dunne & Raby explore the question of how we deal with an environment that is rapidly becoming more digital, smarter and more autonomous. They highlight our often ambivalent relationship to new technologies and discuss the opportunities and challenges that present themselves to us as individuals and as a society in this context. In this regard, ""Hello, Robot"" broadens the scope of the discussion to include the ethical and political questions with which we are faced today in the light of technological advances in robotics, while confronting us with the contradictions that are often found in the answers to these questions.

In this book a number of innovative Arendt scholars come together to ask how we should think about these remarkable writings in the context of Arendt’s published writing and broader political thinking.  Unique in its form, the 'Denktagebuch' offers brilliant insights into Arendt’s practice of thinking and writing. 'Artifacts of Thinking' provides an introduction to the 'Denktagebuch' as well as a glimpse of these fascinating but untranslated fragments that reveal not only Arendt’s understanding of “the life of the mind” but her true lived experience of it.

CARING FOR ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN ON INPATIENT CHILD PSYCHIATRIC UNITS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY,Patricia Anne Fazzone,mental_health,1991.0,OL5700125W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Caring for abused and neglected children on inpatient child psychiatric units presents many difficulties for staff. This cross-sectional ethnography explored the context, conditions, factors, and interactive processes which influenced how staff perceived caring for these children in inpatient child psychiatric settings. Three different child psychiatric units participated in the study: (a) a private for-profit, (b) a private not-for-profit, and (c) a public unit. The sample, identified as ""consultants"" (n = 29), included staff from various disciplines. The Ethnoscience perspective, Symbolic Interactionism, and Human Caring framed this study. Data collection methods included participant observation, interviews, case studies, review of organizational documents, and focus groups. Systematic data analysis identified twelve major issues that concerned staff. Staff considered six of these twelve issues as the ""most important"", ""most difficult"" or issues the staff most wanted to talk about during the focus groups. They were: (a) developing a relationship with abused and/or neglected children, (b) dealing with aggressive behavior, (c) dealing with sexual acting out, (d) Satanism and ritualistic cults, (e) dealing with abusive parents, and (f) the need for more education and training in caring for abused and neglected children. Specific factors, that staff felt impeded caring for these children, included organizational issues, unit issues, staff-patient issues, staff-parent issues, and staff's personal issues. Administrators, educators and practitioners, may use these data to improve the context, conditions, personal and social processes which may impact staff's ability to care for abused and neglected children on inpatient child psychiatric units.

Puccini's Ghosts,Morag Joss,psychology,2005.0,OL5822595W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9328646M-M.jpg,"CWA Silver Dagger Award winner Morag Joss peers into the soul of a wounded family in this haunting, harrowing masterpiece of psychological suspense. With equal parts subtlety and menace, Joss takes us on a dizzying journey toward a collision between fantasy and reality--and an astounding moment of revelation that shatters illusions, hopes, and lives forever.The year is 1960. The place is a Scottish seaside town utterly devoid of culture and charm. Here, Lila lives as the third player in her parents' dramatically embittered marriage. Until her flamboyant, irrepressible uncle George shows up from London and her family decides to squander a windfall on the most preposterous of causes: a civic production of the Puccini opera Turandot.Lila knows nothing of opera and little of her uncle or the dashing young man he hires to sing the role of Calaf. But Lila does know passion. Because it's coursing through her veins--and rushing blindly, wildly all around her. Now a girl on the verge of womanhood is about to blunder into a grown-up world where secrets are kept and exposed, hopes soar and wither, and where crimes petty and great exact the most chilling punishments of all.Masterfully paced and spellbinding till its final, haunting scene, Puccini's Ghosts is a piercing look into the fierce darkness that lurks behind seemingly ordinary lives.From the Hardcover edition.

However, the integration of human resource strategy with overall business strategy is often easier in theory than in practice. Strategic Human Resource Management provides a bridge between theory and practice and offers a guide to both formulating human resource strategies and implementing them.  This new edition has been fully updated and revised to incorporate the latest thinking, research and practice in this important field, using case studies, checklists and practical examples. Human resource strategies are only as good as the effective action they produce. Formulating them is the easy part. The difficulties begin when they have to be implemented.

Bittersweet,Danielle Steel,literature,1999.0,OL19687W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24295754M-M.jpg,"In Bittersweet, Danielle Steel has written a novel for our times, a story of choices and new beginnings.India Taylor lived in a world of manicured lawns and neatly maintained calendars: a merry-go-round of Little League, piano lessons, and Cape Cod summer vacations. With four wonderful children, India believed in commitment and sacrifice, just as she believed in Doug, the man she married 17 years before. For India, this was the promise she made, the life she had chosen--not the award-winning career as a photojournalist she once had. It was a choice she had never truly regretted. Until she begins to regret it with all her heart.India couldn't pinpoint the exact moment. Perhaps it was the last time her agent called, begging her to take an assignment Doug insisted she turn down. Or perhaps it was when Doug told her he thought of her as a companion and someone to take care of their kids, and not much more. At that moment, the price of the sacrifices she'd made began to seem high.And then, she met Paul Ward. A Wall Street tycoon married to a bestselling author, Paul lived life on his own terms, traveling the world on his own yacht. India hadn't planned to become Paul's friend. Anything more was unthinkable. Yet talking to Paul was so easy. India could share her dreams with him, and offer comfort when Paul suffers a heartbreak of his own. And while Paul urges India to reclaim her career, Doug is adamantly against it, determined to keep her tied to the home. But with Paul's encouragement, India slowly, painfully, begins to break free, and find herself again.Rediscovering her creativity and her courage, India uses Paul like a beacon on the horizon, sharing intimate phone conversations with a man half a world away, a man who never stops reminding her of all that is possible for her. India is changing, and nothing in her life will ever be the same again. Not her marriage. Not her friendship with Paul. And when India is presented with an irresistible opportunity, she makes a heart-wrenching decision, leaving a safe, familiar place-and the people she loves there-to move into the terror of the unknown.Bittersweet is her story, a story of freedom, of having dreams and making choices to find them. With unerring insight, Danielle Steel has created a moving portrait of a woman who dares to embark on a new adventure and the man who helps her get there. Her painful, exhilarating journey inspires us all.From the Paperback edition.   Read more Read less",Random House Publishing Group

FBI agent Brett Cody can't believe it. Dead or alive, the man had loved his wife. Brett also can't help feeling guilty, since he was responsible for protecting Miguel and Maria Gomez. A few miles away, Lara Mayhew has just begun working at a dolphin research facility. She loves her new job -- until a dolphin brings her something unexpected from the deep: a human hand. More body parts show up, and when Brett looks into the situation, he discovers that the dismembered corpse is Miguel's. Soon, rumors of crazed zombies abound in the Miami media, and the Krewe of Hunters, an elite FBI unit of paranormal investigators, is called in. Brett and Lara find themselves working with the Krewe -- and working closely together. An elderly crime boss who's losing his memory seems to be key to solving this case, but there's no motive. Unless Brett and Lara can uncover one in the Miami underworld. And that means they have to protect themselves. And each other.   Read more Read less",

This is his revisiting of the same concepts 25 years later in a novel that he describes as his own, almost in entirety. Over all not a bad read.    In a nutshell, the Russians have the technology to miniaturize anything, but at a huge and impractical cost in power. They kidnap an American ""neurophysicist"", whose ideas of interpreting the electrochemistry of thought have been widely ridiculed and rejected in the states. He is to be a part of a desperate plan to miniaturize a small submarine with a crew of five to be injected into the brain of a comatose patient, specifically the very scientist who possessed the secret of making the miniaturization process economically practical. If the discredited American's theories are correct he might help the Russians recover that secret from the unconscious but still functioning brain of the patient. It is also a chance for him to prove his own theories once and for all.   Read more Read less",Doubleday

Can be read as a stand-alone novel.  Tempus and his Stepsons, far from Thieves' World and Sanctuary, continue their fight for the independence of Nisibis against the expanding Mygdonian empire.  Nisibis and Mygdonia are actual ancient places, and this book has the feel of ancient mythology.  Sorceresses and gods take a hand in the battle.  Ancient cavalry warfare and the exploits of Tempus's Sacred Band of lovers and friends make this book compelling and much more real than most fantasy.  The same-sex lovers of the Sacred Band, an elite war-band modeled on the Sacred Band of Thebes, risk everything for honor in this sophisticated tale of men at war, gods and sorcery as Tempus's partner, Niko, is stalked by the Nisibisi with, Roxane.

Beyond belief,Elaine Pagels,religion,2003.0,OL3748807W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3565074M-M.jpg,"Elaine Pagels, one of the world's most important writers and thinkers on religion and history, and winner of the National Book Award for her groundbreaking work The Gnostic Gospels, now reflects on what matters most about spiritual and religious exploration in the twenty-first century. This bold new book explores how Christianity began by tracing its earliest texts, including the secret Gospel of Thomas, rediscovered in Egypt in 1945.When her infant son was diagnosed with fatal pulmonary hypertension, Elaine Pagels's spiritual and intellectual quest took on a new urgency, leading her to explore historical and archeological sources and to investigate what Jesus and his teachings meant to his followers before the invention of doctrine--and before the invention of Christianity as we know it. The astonishing discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, along with more than fifty other early Christian texts unknown since antiquity, offers startling clues. Pagels compares such sources as Thomas's gospel (which claims to give Jesus' secret teaching, and finds its closest affinities with kabbalah) with the canonic texts to show how Christian leaders chose to include some gospels and exclude others from the collection we have come to know as the New Testament. To stabilize the emerging Christian church in times of devastating persecution, the church fathers constructed the canon, creed, and hierarchy--and, in the process, suppressed many of its spiritual resources. Drawing on new scholarship--her own, and that of an international group of scholars--that has come to light since the publication in 1979 of The Gnostic Gospels, Pagels shows that what matters about Christianity involves much more than any one set of beliefs. Traditions embodied in Judaism and Christianity can powerfully affect us in heart, mind, and spirit, inspire visions of a new society based on practicing justice and love, even heal and transform us.Provocative, beautifully written, and moving, Beyond Belief, the most personal of Pagels's books to date, shows how ""the impulse to seek God overflows the narrow banks of a single tradition."" Pagels writes, ""What I have come to love in the wealth and diversity of our religious traditions--and the communities that sustain them--is that they offer the testimony of innumerable people to spiritual discovery, encouraging us, in Jesus' words, to 'seek, and you shall find.'""

The prepositioned War Reserve (PWR) of the Marine Corps is a measure of sustainability: a desired output of the PPBS. This thesis investigated the PPBS, the Marine Corps programming methodology and ammunition requirement generation to determine whether these processes artificially constrain ammunition purchases. This thesis suggests that the constraints placed on ammunition requirements are related to the lack of long-range strategic goals, inadequate planning in the PPBS and the inherent weaknesses of program budgeting.

It was the basis for the movie Paper Moon (1973) directed by Peter Bogdanovich. The novel was re-printed in 2002 as a paperback with the title Paper Moon: A Novel.  The novel is narrated by Addie, an orphaned girl, who travels with confidence man ""Long Boy"" Moses Pray in the early 1930s, during the Great Depression. Their travels are mainly in the State of Alabama, but they do go elsewhere on occasion. The second half of the novel takes place in and around New Orleans, where Addie and Mose become involved in a scam with confidence man Colonel Culpepper. This portion of the tale would be omitted from the film Paper Moon.  Addie states at the beginning of the novel that Long Boy may or may not be her father; she says that her late mother was the ""wildest"" girl in her town, and that Long Boy is one of her three possible fathers. The book features three scams not depicted in the movie, including bilking cotton dealers, investors in a worthless mine, and a wealthy lawyer in New Orleans.

Raised in liberal Ashland, Oregon, by parents who were Jewish by birth but dismissive of strict dogma, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross converted to Islam in college-a process that began with a desire to connect with both a religious community and a spiritual practice, and eventually led him to sympathize with the most extreme interpretations of the faith with the most radical political implications. In the year following graduation, Gartenstein-Ross went to work for the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, a charity dedicated to fostering Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia's austere form of Islam-a theological inspiration for many terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda. Shortly after he left Al Haramain-when his own fanaticism had waned-the foundation was charged by the U. S. government for a money-laundering scheme that was seemingly designed to finance terrorist organizations. Gartenstein-Ross, by this time a lawyer at a prominent firm, volunteered for questioning by the FBI. They already knew who he was. The story of how a good faith can be distorted and a decent soul can be seduced away from his principles, My Year Inside Radical Islam provides a rare glimpse into the personal interface between religion and politics.

A trip to New York, wife by his side, to visit his new publisher. Finally, after years of lonely struggle it looks as though the gods of fate are on his side. But on the way back to Penn station, a chance encounter changes all of that. David bumps into a man who covertly follows him and, just before he boards the train, passes by him close enough to whisper: 'Remember me.' When the stranger turns up in his home town, David begins to understand that this man wants something from him ... something very personal that he may have no choice but to surrender. Meanwhile, back in New York, ex-lawyer John Henderson does his girlfriend Kristina a favour and agrees to talk to Catherine Warren, an acquaintance of hers who believes she's being stalked by an ex-lover.

Heideman,physics,1988.0,OL19889613W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27076286M-M.jpg,This book introduces multiplicative complexity theory and applies it to the computation of discrete convolutions and the discrete Fourier transform. A mathematical framework is established that enables the multiplicative complexity of many common bilinear systems to be determined. Semilinear systems are introduced as a means of determining the multiplicative complexity of the discrete Fourier transform. Complexity results are derived for other discrete transforms such as the cosine and Hartley transforms. Complete proofs of all the major results are included - the book is essentially self-contained. Many examples are provided to demonstrate the application of the theory.   Read more Read less,Springer New York

Often such models are so delicate such that we need e cient solver methods to overcome the di culties. Therefore, we discuss the ideas of solving such multiscale and multiphysics problems with the help of splitting multiscale methods. We describe analytical and numerical methods in time and space for evolution equations that arise from engineering problems and their applications. The book gives an overview of coupled systems in applications:   Coupling of separate scales: Micro- and macroscale problems (coupling separate scales)   Coupling of multiple scales: Multiscale problems (homogenization of the scales)   Coupling of logical scales: Multiphysics problems (multiple physical processes on a logical scale) The mathematical introduction describes the analytical and numerical methods which are used with respect to their e ectiveness, simplicity, stability and consistency. The algorithmic part discuss the methods, which are discussed with respect to their capability of solving problems in real-life applications to engineering tasks. In the experiment part, we present engineering problems with respect to the used code and implementation. The idea is to consider a theoretical approach to coupled systems with novel and specialized single and multiple scale methods.

Desperate for an answer, they turned to Waldo, the crippled genius who lived in a zero-g home in orbit around Earth. But Waldo had little reason to want to help the rest of humanity -- until he learned that the solution to their problems also held the key to his own...  Magic, Inc.:    Under the guise of an agency for magicians, Magic, Inc. was systematically squeezing out the small independent magicians. Then one businessman stood firm. With the help of an Oxford-educated African shaman and a little old lady adept at black magic, he went straight to the demons of Hell to resolve the problem -- once and for all!

Nordenholt's Million,Alfred Walter Stewart,science_fiction,1923.0,OL11619999W,//archive.org/services/img/in.ernet.dli.2015.69106,"Famine sweeps across the world when a lab accident unleashes a virulent strain of bacteria that transforms healthy fields into barren wastelands. With the fate of the human race at stake, wealthy financier Stanley Nordenholt establishes a stronghold in central Scotland and assumes dictatorial powers to save what remains of the planet's starving population. This gripping tale of survival explores some of the moral dilemmas that arise in the wake of catastrophic events as well as their social, cultural, and political consequences.    A precursor to the latter-day tales from the golden age of science fiction, this compelling novel was published by a noted British chemist in 1923. Acclaimed by the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction as ""realistic, reasoned, sociologically observed, and credible,"" it offers an ever-relevant warning against the exploitation of disaster as a pretext for the suspension of freedom, democracy, and justice.

Il s'agit précisément de mener à son terme, dans un système unifié du savoir, la détermination de l'étant en procédant à son extension à la question de l'être de l'homme et de l'être-en-commun propre à la société politique. Au commencement du XVII° siècle, une autre direction pour l'accomplissement du projet ontologique non identifiable à celle d'une science mathématique de la nature se profile et préfigure une récurrence persistante des origines de la philosophie. Ainsi, on trouve dans le système suarézien la retranscription originale et réactualisée d'une ligne de force traversant la pensée antique: l'ontopolitique.

"A new American tea party: the counterrevolution against bailouts, handouts, reckless spending, and more taxes",John M. O'Hara,business__economics,2009.0,OL15111187W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23918932M-M.jpg,"An engaging look behind the modern day tax tea parties.   What has driven hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets in protest since late February, 2009? A cry of ""enough"" government expansion and interference and reassertion of individual liberty: a first principle that became a rallying cry behind a movement. A New American Tea Party presents the voices behind the growing discontent among every day citizens with increased government taxation, spending, and intervention.   Author John M. O'Hara - a rising star in the conservative/libertarian movement - played an integral role in starting the first modern day tea party in February of 2008, an effort that sparked off a nation wide movement. On tax day in April 2009, hundreds of thousands of citizens gathered in more than 800 cities to voice their opposition to out of control spending at all levels of government. In August, citizens in every state of the union made their voices heard at congressional town hall meetings. On September 12, 2009 over half a million people marched on the U.S. Capitol.   A New American Tea Party explains how these protests evolved and were organized, and distills the results-including the often bizarre media backlashes-of the movement, the philosophy behind the movement, and the road ahead. Written by one of the leading organizers behind the protests, this book shows you how the costs of bailouts and other excessive government interference today is philosophically incompatible with the founding principles of our nation and simply unsustainable for future generations.    Skillfully lays out the case against excessive government interference and why the tea party movement is necessary and significant  Written by one of the top organizers and leaders of the tea party movement  Offers a look into current and future policy battles and how the movement will grow in response     If you're concerned with the growth of government, the state of the union we will pass on to the next generation, and you want to see a roadmap for a better way forward, then you need to read A New American Tea Party.The EPUB format of this title may not be compatible for use on all handheld devices.

The argument is developed further by essays from Clare Woodford, Tracy B. Strong, Margaret Kohn, Davide Panagia and Thomas Dunn, to which Dienstag responds in the concluding chapter, 'A reply to my critics'.   Read more Read less",

Harmonic Analysis of Spherical Functions on Real Reductive Groups,Ramesh Gangolli,mathematics,1988.0,OL19854805W,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27043003M-M.jpg,"The purpose of this book is to give a thorough treatment of the harmonic analysis of spherical functions on symmetric spaces. The theory was originally created by Harish-Chandra in the late 1950's and important additional contributions were made by many others in the succeeding years. The book attempts to give a definite treatment of these results from the spectral theoretic viewpoint. The harmonic analysis of spherical functions treated here contains the essentials of large parts of harmonic analysis of more general functions on semisimple Lie groups. Since the latter involves many additional technical complications, it will be very illuminating for any potential student of general harmonic analysis to see how the basic ideas emerge in the context of spherical functions. With this in mind, an attempt has been made only to use those methods (as far as possible) which generalize. Mathematicians and graduate students as well as mathematical physicists interested in semisimple Lie groups, homogeneous spaces, representations and harmonic analysis will find this book stimulating.

R is a powerful open-source implementation of the statistical language S, which was developed by AT&T. R has eclipsed S and the commercially-available S-Plus language, and has become the de facto standard for doing, teaching, and learning computational statistics.  R is both an object-oriented language and a functional language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and completely free. A large community of dedicated R users and programmers provides an excellent source of R code, functions, and data sets. R is also becoming adopted into commercial tools such as Oracle Database. Your investment in learning R is sure to pay off in the long term as R continues to grow into the go to language for statistical exploration and research.   Covers the freely-available R language for statistics  Shows the use of R in specific uses case such as simulations, discrete probability solutions, one-way ANOVA analysis, and more  Takes a hands-on and example-based approach incorporating best practices with clear explanations of the statistics being done     Read more Read less","Apress,              Imprint: Apress"

Only the long-vanquished Lady of Pain and Fire had been able to challenge his rule. At the age of fifteen, citizens are recognized as adults and must don the spell infused masks which denote both status and profession, whenever they are in public. To maintain the secure rule of the kingdom, the masks are magically crafted to reveal any treasonous thoughts or actions. And once such betrayals are exsposed, the watchers are there to enforce the law. Mara Holdfast, daughter of the Autarch's master maskmaker, is fast approaching her fifteenth birthday and her all important masking ceremony. Her father himself has been working behind closed doors to create Mara's mask. Once the ceremony is done, she will take her place as an adult, and gifted with the same magical abilities as her father, she will also claim her rightful place as his apprentice. But on the day of her masking something goes horribly wrong.   Read more Read less",

Feminisms in social work research,Stephanie Wahab,political_science,2014.0,OL23181237W,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"""Social work as a profession and academic discipline has long centered women and issues of concern to women, such as reproductive rights, labor rights, equal rights, violence and poverty. In fact, the social work profession was started by and maintained in large part by women and has been home to several generations of feminists starting with recognized first wave feminists. This wide-ranging volume both maps the contemporary landscape of feminist social work research, and offers a deep engagement with critical and third wave feminisms in social work research. Showcasing the breadth and depth of exemplary social work feminist research, the editors argue that social work's unique focus on praxis, daily proximities to privilege and oppression, concern with social change and engagement with participatory forms of inquiry place social workers in a unique position to both learn from and contribute to broader social science and humanities discourse associated with feminist research. The authors attend here to their specific claims of feminisms, articulate deep engagement with theory, address the problematic use of binaries, and engage with issues associated with methods that are consistently of interest to feminist researchers, such as power and authority, ethics, reflexivity, praxis and difference. Comprehensive and containing an international selection of contributions, Feminisms in Social Work Research is an important reference for all social work researchers with an interest in critical perspectives""--   Read more Read less",

But their delicate balance comes crashing down with the arrival of new dropships from space.  These new arrivals are the lucky ones—back on the Colony, the oxygen is almost gone—but after making it safely to Earth, GLASS’s luck seems to be running out. CLARKE leads a rescue party to the crash site, ready to treat the wounded, but she can’t stop thinking about her parents, who may still be alive. Meanwhile, WELLS struggles to maintain his authority despite the presence of the Vice Chancellor and his armed guards, and BELLAMY must decide whether to face or flee the crimes he thought he’d left behind.

One of the very few novels of the twentieth century which can be ranked with the work of Dostoevsky, The Woman of Rome also tells the stories of the tortured university student Giacomo, a failed revolutionary who refuses to admit his love for Adriana; of the sinister figure of Astarita, the Secret Police officer obsessed with Adriana; and of the coarse and brutal criminal, Sonzogno, who treats Adriana as his private property. Within this story of passion and betrayal, Moravia calmly strips away the pride and arrogance hiding the corrupt heart of Italian Fascism.   Read more Read less","Farrar, Straus"
